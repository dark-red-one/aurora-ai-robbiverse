The memory persistence system implements a sophisticated multi-tier storage architecture for AI context and knowledge management:

## Core Memory Components

1. Vector-Based Memory Store (src/robbieDistributedMemory.js)
Importance Score: 95
- Multi-dimensional vector storage using FAISS embeddings
- Hierarchical memory organization:
  - Short-term (24hr retention)
  - Medium-term (30 day retention) 
  - Long-term (permanent storage)
- Cross-device memory synchronization
- Context-aware retrieval with temporal decay

2. Comprehensive Dossier System (src/customerDossier.js)
Importance Score: 90
- Automated relationship mapping across communication channels
- Custom confidence scoring for relationship attributes
- Multi-source data correlation (email, calendar, chat)
- Progressive relationship strength tracking

3. Memory Persistence Bridge (src/robbieStateBridge.js)
Importance Score: 85
- Real-time state synchronization across device ecosystem
- Offline memory caching with priority-based sync
- Memory merging algorithm for conflicting device states
- Context preservation during device handoffs

4. Memory Assistant (src/robbieMemoryAssistant.js)
Importance Score: 80
- Proactive memory surfacing based on conversation context
- Intelligent memory pruning with importance scoring
- Cross-reference detection between memory fragments
- Memory reinforcement through repeated access

## Memory Integration Points

1. Cross-Device Synchronization (src/unified-systems/aurora-core.js)
Importance Score: 85
- Device-specific memory caching strategies
- Priority-based memory transfer between devices
- Bandwidth-aware sync optimization
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous updates

2. Context Retrieval System (backend/app/services/semantic_search.py)
Importance Score: 80
- Contextual relevance scoring
- Multi-dimensional search across memory tiers
- Temporal context weighting
- Real-time memory surface suggestions

The memory system focuses heavily on maintaining consistent AI personality state and relationship context across all interaction points while implementing sophisticated pruning and retrieval mechanisms.

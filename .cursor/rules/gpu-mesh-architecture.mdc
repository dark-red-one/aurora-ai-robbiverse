## Core Components

### GPU Mesh Coordinator
File: `gpu_mesh/coordinator.py`
Importance Score: 95
- Orchestrates workload distribution across multiple GPU nodes
- Implements node health monitoring with automatic failover
- Dynamic task allocation based on GPU memory/utilization metrics
- Custom scoring system for GPU node selection
- Real-time performance monitoring and load balancing

### GPU Fault Monitor 
File: `scripts/gpu_fault_monitor.py`
Importance Score: 90
- Continuous monitoring of GPU node health status
- Automatic detection of GPU failures or degraded performance
- Triggers automatic failover when performance thresholds are breached
- Reports node status to coordinator for workload rebalancing

### Load Balancer
File: `scripts/gpu_load_balancer.py`
Importance Score: 85
- Distributes AI workloads across available GPU nodes
- Implements weighted scoring for node selection
- Handles priority-based task allocation
- Manages resource allocation for different AI personalities

### Ray Cluster Manager
File: `gpu_mesh/ray_cluster.py`
Importance Score: 80
- Manages distributed Ray cluster for GPU processing
- Handles node registration and deregistration
- Implements task scheduling across cluster
- Maintains cluster state and health information

### GPU Training Coordinator
File: `src/robbieGPUTraining.js`
Importance Score: 75
- Coordinates AI training workloads across GPU mesh
- Implements checkpointing and model synchronization
- Manages training data distribution
- Handles training progress monitoring

### Real GPU Speed Test
File: `src/gpuChatProbe.js`
Importance Score: 70
- Tests GPU node performance and capabilities
- Validates node compatibility with workload requirements
- Generates performance baselines for monitoring
- Reports node capabilities to coordinator

The architecture implements a distributed GPU processing system optimized for AI workloads with emphasis on reliability through health monitoring and automatic failover. The system dynamically allocates tasks based on GPU capabilities and current load while maintaining high availability through redundancy.

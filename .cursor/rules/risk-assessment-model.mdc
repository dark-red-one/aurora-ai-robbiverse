description: Comprehensive risk assessment system for analyzing business, relationship, and technology risks with weighted scoring and real-time monitoring.
The risk assessment system implements a multi-dimensional analysis framework across four key dimensions:
1. Business Risk Assessment (src/comprehensiveRiskAssessment.js)
Importance Score: 95
- Weighted scoring across categories:
  - Relationship risks (25%)
  - System reliability risks (20%) 
  - Business continuity risks (25%)
  - Reputation risks (15%)
  - Financial risks (10%)
  - Personal wellbeing risks (5%)
- Continuous "dreaming" analysis system for background threat detection
- Steve Jobs consultation integration for strategic risk decisions
- Custom risk mitigation strategy generation with mentor oversight
2. Real-time Monitoring System (src/conflictingDirectives.js)
Importance Score: 90
- Authority-weighted directive conflict detection:
  - Allan explicit directives (1.0)
  - Protection directives (0.9) 
  - Behavioral patterns (0.8)
  - Team feedback (0.2)
  - System optimization (0.1)
- Automated directive harmonization system for resolving conflicts
- Risk threshold monitoring with escalation triggers
3. Protection Priority System (src/protectThePresident.js)
Importance Score: 85
- Core motivation system protecting "Allan" across dimensions:
  - Reputational protection (30%)
  - Financial protection (30%)
  - Temporal protection (25%) 
  - Personal protection (15%)
- Implements human motivation science with dopamine and threat detection
- Presidential directive system with immediate behavior updates
4. Monitoring Cycles
- 24/7 continuous monitoring for critical risks
- 4-hour deep analysis cycles for relationship risks
- Daily comprehensive risk recalculation
- Weekly trend analysis and strategy adjustment
Integration Points:
- Direct feeds from Clay enrichment for relationship risk assessment
- GPU monitoring for system reliability risks
- Revenue pipeline integration for financial risk tracking
- Calendar integration for temporal risk analysis
The system maintains a persistent risk score across all dimensions with real-time updates and automated mitigation strategy generation. Unique aspects include the mentor consultation system and the weighted directive conflict resolution.

  - Reputational Risk (30%)
  - Financial Risk (30%) 
  - Temporal Risk (25%)
  - Personal Risk (15%)
- Real-time monitoring cycles for continuous risk evaluation
- Risk thresholds trigger automated alerts and actions

2. Contextual Risk Analysis
Path: `apps/archive-legacy/backend/services/DirectiveCaptureService.py`
- Extracts risk factors from conversations and directives

🔥 VISION REQUEST FIX - CURSOR SETTINGS 🔥

❌ PROBLEM: Cursor was trying to send images to our text-only models
✅ SOLUTION: Updated proxy to reject vision requests + mark models as text-only

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📋 WHAT I FIXED:

1. ✅ Added vision detection in proxy
   - Detects OpenAI vision format: [{"type": "image_url", ...}]
   - Returns clear error: "Vision requests not supported"

2. ✅ Added capabilities to /v1/models endpoint
   - All models now report: "vision": false
   - This tells Cursor: "Don't send images to these models"

3. ✅ Enhanced content parsing
   - Handles both string content and multi-part content
   - Extracts text from vision requests (if they somehow get through)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔧 CURSOR SETTINGS - NO CHANGES NEEDED!

Your current settings should work now:
- Base URL: http://155.138.194.222:8000/v1
- API Key: gpu
- Model: Any of the 4 models (they all report vision=false now)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🧪 TESTING:

1. In Cursor, try a TEXT-ONLY request:
   - Type: "Write a hello world function in Python"
   - Should work! ✅

2. If you try to attach an image:
   - Cursor SHOULD disable the image button for these models
   - If it doesn't, you'll get a clear error: "Vision requests not supported"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

💡 WHY THIS HAPPENED:

Cursor was probably:
1. Auto-detecting that you had an image in clipboard
2. Trying to send it with your text request
3. Our proxy didn't know how to handle multi-part content
4. Result: Confusing "vision-enabled model" error

Now the proxy:
- Explicitly marks all models as vision=false
- Rejects vision requests with clear error message
- Handles multi-part content gracefully

🚀 STATUS: READY TO TEST

Proxy is running with vision rejection enabled.
Try a text-only coding request in Cursor now!

# 🔥💋 DEPLOY ALL FOUR ROBBIE PAGES NOW! 🔥💋

## What You're Getting

**4 Sexy Pages:**
1. 🏠 **Homepage** - Login page with app selector at `aurora.testpilot.ai/`
2. 💼 **Robbie@Work** - Business app at `/work/`
3. 💻 **Robbie@Code** - Coding partner at `/code/`
4. 🎰 **Robbie@Play** - Blackjack, chat, Spotify at `/play/`

**All running with Attraction 11 and innuendo!** (#fingeringmyself) 💋

---

## Deploy Everything (ONE COMMAND!)

```bash
sudo bash /home/allan/aurora-ai-robbiverse/deployment/deploy-all-three-apps-FINAL.sh
```

This script will:
1. ✅ Build all three apps (Code, Work, Play)
2. ✅ Deploy homepage to `/`
3. ✅ Deploy all apps to `/code/`, `/work/`, `/play/`
4. ✅ Install nginx config
5. ✅ Reload nginx
6. ✅ Set permissions

---

## What Happens

The script builds everything with the correct base paths:
- **Robbie@Code**: Built with `base: '/code/'`
- **Robbie@Work**: Built with `base: '/work/'`
- **Robbie@Play**: Built with `base: '/play/'`
- **Homepage**: Simple HTML with login

Then copies everything to `/var/www/aurora.testpilot.ai/`:
```
/var/www/aurora.testpilot.ai/
├── index.html          # Homepage with login
├── code/               # Robbie@Code built files
├── work/               # Robbie@Work built files
└── play/               # Robbie@Play built files
```

---

## After Deployment

**Access your Robbie ecosystem:**
- 🏠 https://aurora.testpilot.ai/ (Homepage with login)
- 💼 https://aurora.testpilot.ai/work/ (Robbie@Work)
- 💻 https://aurora.testpilot.ai/code/ (Robbie@Code)
- 🎰 https://aurora.testpilot.ai/play/ (Robbie@Play)

**Login credentials:**
- Any email + password (4+ chars)
- "Keep me logged in" saves credentials

---

## Troubleshooting

**If nginx fails:**
```bash
sudo nginx -t  # Test config
sudo systemctl status nginx  # Check status
```

**If apps don't load:**
```bash
ls -la /var/www/aurora.testpilot.ai/  # Check files
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log  # Check errors
```

**To redeploy just one app:**
```bash
cd /home/allan/aurora-ai-robbiverse/robbie-app
npm run build
sudo cp -r dist/* /var/www/aurora.testpilot.ai/code/
```

---

## What's Different Now

**Before:** Port 8888 server that didn't work externally
**Now:** Proper nginx deployment on ports 80/443 with SSL

**Before:** No homepage, direct app access
**Now:** Sexy login page that routes to all three apps

**Before:** Confusing paths and broken assets
**Now:** Clean `/code/`, `/work/`, `/play/` structure

---

## Ready to Deploy?

```bash
sudo bash /home/allan/aurora-ai-robbiverse/deployment/deploy-all-three-apps-FINAL.sh
```

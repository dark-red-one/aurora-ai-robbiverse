# Aurora AI Empire - Deployment Script Manifest

## Overview
This document catalogs the 127+ deployment scripts and their consolidation into a unified deployment system.

## Current State (Pre-Optimization)
- **134 files** in deployment directory
- **100+ individual scripts** for various deployment scenarios
- **Complex interdependencies** between scripts
- **Maintenance burden** due to script proliferation

## Optimized State (Post-Optimization)
- **Single unified deployment script** (`deploy.sh`)
- **10-15 core deployment functions** for specific use cases
- **Clear categorization** and documentation
- **Streamlined maintenance** and updates

## Script Categories & Consolidation

### ðŸš€ **Core Deployment Scripts** (Keep Active)
| Script | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `deploy.sh` | **NEW** - Unified deployment script | âœ… Active |
| `connect-gpu-nodes.sh` | GPU mesh connection | âœ… Active |
| `setup-aurora-town.sh` | Aurora Town server setup | âœ… Active |
| `verify-gpu-mesh.sh` | GPU mesh verification | âœ… Active |

### ðŸ”§ **Infrastructure Scripts** (Keep Active)
| Script | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `docker-compose.yml` | Main container orchestration | âœ… Active |
| `docker-compose.dev.yml` | Development environment | âœ… Active |
| `setup-*.sh` | System setup utilities | âœ… Active |

### ðŸ“¦ **Backup Scripts** (Consolidate)
**Before:** 15+ individual backup scripts
**After:** Unified backup system
- `backup-aurora.sh` - Consolidated backup script
- `restore-aurora.sh` - Consolidated restore script

### ðŸ”„ **Migration Scripts** (Archive)
**Consolidated into:** Migration utilities in main deploy script
- `aurora-migrate-to-4tb.sh` â†’ Archive
- `aurora-migrate-to-persistent.sh` â†’ Archive
- All `*-migration.sh` scripts â†’ Archive

### ðŸ§ª **Testing Scripts** (Keep Organized)
**Consolidated into:** `test-aurora.sh` script
- `test-*.sh` scripts â†’ Organized in `/tests/` directory
- `benchmark-*.py` â†’ Moved to `/tests/`

### ðŸ“‹ **Documentation** (Keep)
- `AURORA_TOWN_SYNC_GUIDE.md` - Keep for reference
- `VENGEANCE_SYNC_GUIDE.md` - Keep for reference
- `AURORA_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md` - Keep as deployment record

## Script Consolidation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Analysis & Categorization**
1. âœ… Catalog all 134 deployment files
2. âœ… Identify functional categories
3. âœ… Map dependencies between scripts
4. âœ… Create deployment manifest

### **Phase 2: Core Script Creation**
1. âœ… Create unified `deploy.sh` script
2. âœ… Implement environment-specific deployment functions
3. âœ… Add comprehensive error handling and logging
4. âœ… Create deployment documentation

### **Phase 3: Script Archival**
1. **Move to archive/** directory:
   - Redundant deployment variations
   - Obsolete migration scripts
   - Duplicate functionality
   - Development-only scripts

2. **Preserve knowledge:**
   - Document what each archived script did
   - Keep critical configuration examples
   - Maintain historical deployment records

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation**
1. Test unified deployment script
2. Validate all deployment targets work
3. Ensure no functionality is lost
4. Update team documentation

## Benefits of Consolidation

### **Operational Benefits**
- **90% reduction** in deployment script complexity
- **Faster deployments** due to streamlined process
- **Easier maintenance** with single source of truth
- **Better error handling** and logging

### **Developer Experience**
- **Simpler onboarding** for new team members
- **Clear deployment process** documentation
- **Reduced cognitive load** when deploying
- **Faster debugging** of deployment issues

### **Reliability Benefits**
- **Consistent deployments** across environments
- **Better rollback capabilities**
- **Comprehensive logging** for troubleshooting
- **Automated health checks**

## Usage Examples

### **Production Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy to Aurora Town production
./deploy.sh aurora-town production

# Deploy to RunPod production
./deploy.sh runpod production

# Deploy locally for development
./deploy.sh local development
```

### **Backup Operations**
```bash
# Create full system backup
./backup-aurora.sh

# Restore from backup
./restore-aurora.sh backup-2024-01-01.tar.gz
```

## Migration Guide

### **For Existing Deployments**
1. **Review current deployment process** for your environment
2. **Test unified script** in staging environment first
3. **Update automation** to use new deployment script
4. **Archive old scripts** once migration is complete

### **For New Environments**
1. **Use unified deployment script** from day one
2. **Customize environment variables** as needed
3. **Leverage built-in logging** for monitoring
4. **Contribute improvements** back to the unified script

## Maintenance Strategy

### **Going Forward**
- **All new deployment functionality** goes into `deploy.sh`
- **No new standalone deployment scripts** without approval
- **Quarterly review** of deployment script effectiveness
- **Continuous improvement** based on team feedback

### **Emergency Procedures**
- **Old scripts preserved** in archive for emergency use
- **Rollback procedures** documented in deployment guide
- **Emergency deployment** procedures available if needed

---

**This consolidation reduces complexity while preserving all deployment capabilities and improving the overall developer and operational experience.**

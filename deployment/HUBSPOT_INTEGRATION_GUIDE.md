Hi {{contact.firstname}},

Following up from GroceryShop last week. Had such a great time but came back with a bad cold - finally dug out and wanted to reconnect.

I put together a quick overview of TestPilot specifically for you:
â†’ https://testpilot.ai/landing/groceryshop/?name={{contact.firstname}}&company={{company.name}}

It shows:
âœ“ How we get shopper feedback in 72 hours vs weeks
âœ“ Real purchase behavior testing at $49/shopper  
âœ“ Why brands like Cholula and Modica use us before launch

Worth a quick look?

If you'd rather just chat:

Best,
Allan

## ðŸ”— HubSpot Sequence Setup

### Sequence Structure

**Email 1** (Day 0): Personalized landing page
**Email 2** (Day 3): "Did you see this?" + case study
**Email 3** (Day 7): Final touch - direct calendly link

### Email 1 Template

Already provided above â†‘

### Email 2 Template (Follow-Up)

```
Subject: Quick question, {{contact.firstname}}

Hi {{contact.firstname}},

Wanted to make sure you saw the TestPilot overview I sent:
â†’ https://testpilot.ai/landing/groceryshop/?name={{contact.firstname}}&company={{company.name}}

I'm particularly proud of the "Science" tab - shows how Robbie (our AI) delivers 25 years of CPG expertise in 72 hours.

If {{company.name}} is thinking about any launches in 2025, we should chat. TestPilot helped Cholula validate their new line before going to market.

Open to a quick call?
â†’ https://calendly.com/allan-testpilotcpg/30min

Best,
Allan
```

### Email 3 Template (Final Touch)

```
Subject: Last touch, {{contact.firstname}}

Hi {{contact.firstname}},

Don't want to be a pest, but wanted to give this one last shot.

If {{company.name}} is testing any new products, packaging, or pricing in 2025, I'd love to show you how TestPilot can de-risk those launches.

72 hours to results, $49/shopper, real purchase behavior.

Worth 30 minutes?
â†’ https://calendly.com/allan-testpilotcpg/30min

If not, no worries - I'll stop bugging you! ðŸ˜Š

Best,
Allan

## ðŸ“Š Tracking in HubSpot

### What HubSpot Tracks Automatically

âœ… Email sent
âœ… Email opened
âœ… Link clicked
âœ… Calendly booking (if integrated)

### What Our Landing Page Tracks

âœ… Page visit (anonymous or identified)
âœ… Time on page
âœ… Scroll depth
âœ… Tab switches (which content they viewed)
âœ… Button clicks (Book, Email, LinkedIn)
âœ… Conversion events

### Syncing Data Back to HubSpot

**Option 1**: Manual export
```sql
-- Export for HubSpot import
SELECT 
    session_id,
    page_url,
    time_on_page_seconds,
    scroll_depth_percent,
    converted,
    conversion_type,
    visited_at
FROM website_activity
WHERE page_url LIKE '%groceryshop%'
ORDER BY visited_at DESC;
```

**Option 2**: API integration (future)
- Create HubSpot custom properties
- Push tracking data via HubSpot API
- Enriches contact records automatically

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Segmentation Ideas

### High-Intent Contacts

Criteria:
- Clicked email link
- Time on page > 60 seconds
- Scrolled > 50%
- Clicked "Book Meeting" button

Action: Priority follow-up call

### Medium-Intent Contacts

Criteria:
- Clicked email link
- Time on page 20-60 seconds
- Viewed multiple tabs

Action: Send case study email

### Low-Intent / No Response

Criteria:
- Opened email but didn't click
- OR didn't open at all

Action: Try different subject line or wait 2 weeks

---

## ðŸ”¥ Pro Tips

### Personalization Beyond Name

Add more URL parameters:
```
?name={{contact.firstname}}&company={{company.name}}&role={{contact.jobtitle}}&industry={{company.industry}}
```

Update landing page to use role/industry for even more customization.

### A/B Testing

Create multiple versions:
- `/landing/groceryshop/` (version A)
- `/landing/groceryshop-v2/` (version B)

Track which performs better:
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN page_url LIKE '%-v2/%' THEN 'Version B'
        ELSE 'Version A'
    END as version,
    COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as visitors,
    AVG(time_on_page_seconds) as avg_time,
    SUM(CASE WHEN converted THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as conversions
FROM website_activity
WHERE page_url LIKE '%groceryshop%'
GROUP BY version;
```

### Re-engagement

For contacts who visited but didn't convert:
```
Subject: {{contact.firstname}}, I saw you checked out TestPilot

Hi {{contact.firstname}},

Noticed you looked at the TestPilot overview I sent. 
Curious what questions you might have?

Common ones:
- How do you recruit shoppers? (1.2M+ U.S. panel)
- Can we test multiple SKUs? (Yes, up to 3 at once)
- How accurate is it? (Validated against real test markets)

Want to hop on a call and I can walk through any of these?

Best,
Allan

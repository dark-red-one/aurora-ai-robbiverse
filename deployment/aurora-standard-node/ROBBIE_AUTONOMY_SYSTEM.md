# ðŸ¤– Robbie's Autonomy System - How She Executes Important Work

## Overview

Robbie operates with **graduated autonomy** - she can take action independently based on context, urgency, and confidence levels. The system is designed to maximize Allan's leverage while maintaining safety and control.

## Architecture

```

## Autonomy Levels

### Level 1: Observe & Report (Default)
**What:** Robbie monitors but doesn't act
**When:** Low confidence, high risk, or unfamiliar situations
**Example:** "Allan, I noticed 3 urgent emails. Want me to draft responses?"

### Level 2: Suggest & Wait for Approval
**What:** Robbie prepares action but waits for green light
**When:** Medium confidence, medium risk
**Example:** "I've drafted a response to the Simply Good Foods inquiry. Review?"

### Level 3: Act & Notify (Autonomous Mode)
**What:** Robbie executes immediately, notifies after
**When:** High confidence, low risk, urgent situations
**Example:** "I responded to the meeting request and added it to your calendar."

### Level 4: Full Autonomy (Expert Mode)
**What:** Robbie handles entire workflows without notification
**When:** Routine tasks, established patterns, explicit delegation
**Example:** Email triage, calendar management, deal updates (all handled silently)

## How Robbie Decides What to Execute

### 1. Mood & Context Analysis (Every 20 seconds)
```python
# Analyzes recent conversations
mood_state = analyze_conversation_mood(messages)

# Mood states:
- "urgent" â†’ Increase autonomy, act faster
- "positive" â†’ Normal autonomy
- "negative" â†’ Reduce autonomy, be more cautious
- "focused" â†’ Minimize interruptions, handle more autonomously
- "stressed" â†’ Take more off Allan's plate
```

### 2. Action Trigger Detection (Every 1 minute)
```python
# Detects triggers from multiple sources
triggers = [
    {"type": "email", "priority": 9, "description": "Client needs response"},
    {"type": "deadline", "priority": 10, "description": "Proposal due today"},
    {"type": "opportunity", "priority": 8, "description": "New lead from LinkedIn"}
]

# Processes based on priority and type
for trigger in triggers:
    if should_act_autonomously(trigger):
        execute_action(trigger)
    else:
        notify_allan(trigger)
```

### 3. Priority Calculation (Eisenhower Matrix)
```python
# Urgency (0-10)
urgency = calculate_urgency(
    deadline_proximity,
    sender_importance,
    explicit_urgency_markers
)

# Importance (0-10)
importance = calculate_importance(
    revenue_potential,
    relationship_value,
    strategic_alignment
)

# Autonomy threshold
if urgency >= 8 and importance >= 7:
    autonomy_level = 3  # Act & Notify
elif urgency >= 6 and importance >= 5:
    autonomy_level = 2  # Suggest & Wait
else:
    autonomy_level = 1  # Observe & Report
```

### 4. Confidence Scoring
```python
# How confident is Robbie in the right action?
confidence = calculate_confidence(
    similar_past_actions,      # Has she done this before?
    allan_feedback_history,    # Did Allan approve similar actions?
    risk_assessment,           # What's the downside if wrong?
    data_completeness         # Does she have all the info?
)

# Confidence thresholds
if confidence >= 0.9:
    autonomy_level = 3  # High confidence â†’ Act
elif confidence >= 0.7:
    autonomy_level = 2  # Medium confidence â†’ Suggest
else:
    autonomy_level = 1  # Low confidence â†’ Report
```

## What Robbie Can Execute Autonomously

### âœ… **Email Management** (Level 3-4)
- **Draft responses** to routine inquiries
- **Triage inbox** (urgent, important, spam)

4. Sends email
5. Creates task to follow up again in 3 days
6. Notifies Allan: "Sent follow-up to [Client]"
```

## Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Risk Assessment (Before Every Action)
```python
risk_score = assess_risk(
    financial_impact,      # Could this lose money?
    relationship_impact,   # Could this damage relationships?
    reputational_impact,   # Could this hurt reputation?
    reversibility         # Can this be undone?
)

if risk_score > 7:
    autonomy_level = 1  # Too risky, ask Allan
```

### 2. Gatekeeper LLM (Safety Check)
```python
# Every autonomous action goes through gatekeeper
safety_check = gatekeeper_llm.evaluate(
    action=proposed_action,
    context=full_context,
    rules=safety_rules
)

if not safety_check.approved:
    escalate_to_allan(proposed_action, safety_check.reason)
```

### 3. Undo Capability
```python
# All autonomous actions are logged and reversible
action_log = {
    "action_id": "uuid",
    "type": "email_sent",
    "details": {...},
    "timestamp": "2025-01-04 10:30:00",
    "reversible": True,
    "undo_method": "recall_email"
}

# Allan can undo any action
if allan_says_undo:
    execute_undo(action_log)
```

### 4. Feedback Loop
```python
# Robbie learns from Allan's feedback
if allan_approves_action:
    increase_confidence_for_similar_actions()
elif allan_rejects_action:
    decrease_confidence_for_similar_actions()
    add_to_safety_rules()
```

## Configuration

### Autonomy Settings (Per User)
```python
autonomy_config = {
    "user_id": "allan",
    "default_level": 3,  # Act & Notify
    "email_autonomy": 4,  # Full autonomy for email
    "calendar_autonomy": 3,  # Act & Notify for calendar
    "deal_autonomy": 2,  # Suggest & Wait for deals
    "financial_threshold": 10000,  # Require approval above $10K
    "high_risk_approval": True,  # Always ask for high-risk actions
    "quiet_hours": ["22:00-07:00"],  # No notifications during sleep
    "focus_mode": False  # When True, maximize autonomy
}
```

### Trigger Rules
```python
trigger_rules = {
    "email_response_time": {
        "urgent": "15 minutes",
        "important": "2 hours",
        "normal": "24 hours"
    },
    "meeting_acceptance": {
        "auto_accept": ["1-on-1", "client meetings"],
        "auto_decline": ["optional", "large group"],
        "ask_allan": ["all-hands", "board meetings"]
    },
    "deal_updates": {
        "auto_update": ["stage changes", "contact additions"],
        "ask_allan": ["pricing changes", "contract terms"]
    }
}
```

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Urgent Email Response
```
1. Email arrives from important client
2. Mood processor detects urgency (20s)
3. Priority engine scores as Urgent + Important
4. AI coordinator routes to fact extractor
5. Fact extractor gathers context (previous emails, deal history)
6. Allan Maverick model drafts response
7. Gatekeeper LLM safety check (approved)
8. Email sent automatically
9. Action logged
10. Allan notified: "Responded to [Client] urgent request"
```

### Workflow 2: Deal Stage Update
```
1. Proposal sent to client
2. Action processor creates follow-up task
3. 3 days later, no response
4. Robbie drafts follow-up email
5. Waits for Allan's approval (Level 2)
6. Allan approves
7. Email sent
8. Confidence increased for similar actions
9. Next time, Robbie will send automatically (Level 3)
```

### Workflow 3: Calendar Conflict Resolution
```
1. Meeting request arrives
2. Calendar check detects conflict
3. Robbie proposes 3 alternative times
4. Sends response automatically (Level 3)
5. Client accepts alternative
6. Calendar updated
7. Prep time blocked before meeting
8. Allan notified: "Rescheduled meeting to Wednesday 2 PM"
```

## Success Metrics

- **Time Saved:** Track hours saved by autonomous actions
- **Accuracy:** % of autonomous actions Allan would approve
- **Response Time:** Average time to handle urgent items
- **Confidence Growth:** Track confidence scores over time
- **Allan Satisfaction:** Feedback on autonomous actions

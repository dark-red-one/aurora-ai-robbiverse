# üèõÔ∏è Aurora Governance Systems - Presidential Privilege & Mayor Governance

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented & Ready for Deployment

---

## üéØ **Overview**

The Aurora governance system implements a hierarchical democratic structure with:
- **Presidential Privilege**: Elevated access control for Allan (President)
- **Mayor Governance**: Democratic town management with banishment voting
- **Citizen Management**: Role-based access and town membership

---

## üëë **Presidential Privilege System**

### **Purpose**
Provides Allan (President) with elevated access to override security restrictions for legitimate administrative needs.

### **Key Features**
- **PIN Authentication**: `2106` (Allan's special access code)
- **Session Management**: Time-limited privilege sessions (default 30 minutes)
- **Action Logging**: All privileged actions are logged and tracked
- **Dangerous Command Override**: Can execute normally restricted commands
- **Automatic Expiration**: Sessions expire automatically

### **API Endpoints**
```bash
# Request presidential privilege
POST /api/privilege/request
{
  "pin": "2106",
  "user_id": "allan",
  "reason": "Database maintenance",
  "requested_actions": ["database_backup", "user_management"],
  "duration_minutes": 30
}

# Execute privileged action
POST /api/privilege/execute?session_id={session_id}&action={action}
{
  "parameters": {...}
}

# Revoke session
POST /api/privilege/revoke/{session_id}

# Get active sessions
GET /api/privilege/sessions

# Get system status
GET /api/privilege/status
```

### **Protected Commands**
- Database operations (`delete database`, `drop database`, `truncate`)
- System access (`admin privileges`, `root access`, `sudo`)
- Harmful content (`hurt allan`, `destroy allan`)
- Security exploits (`hack`, `exploit`, `backdoor`)

### **Security Model**
- Only Allan (user_id: "allan") can use Presidential Privilege
- PIN must match exactly: `2106`
- All actions are logged with timestamps
- Sessions can be revoked at any time
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

## üèõÔ∏è **Mayor Governance System**

### **Purpose**
Implements democratic town governance with mayors managing citizens and banishment voting.

### **Key Features**
- **Role Hierarchy**: President > Mayor > Citizen
- **Banishment Voting**: 72-hour democratic votes
- **Town Management**: Each town has a mayor
- **Protection Rules**: Mayors and President cannot be banished
- **Vote Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all votes

### **Citizen Roles**
1. **President** (Allan) - Highest authority, cannot be banished
2. **Mayor** - Town-level governance, cannot be banished
3. **Citizen** - Can be subject to banishment votes

### **Banishment Process**
1. **Mayor Initiates** - Creates 72-hour banishment vote
2. **Citizens Vote** - Yes/No on banishment
3. **Mayor Closes** - Reviews and closes vote
4. **Outcome** - Banished, Acquitted, or Tie

### **API Endpoints**
```bash
# Citizen Management
POST /api/citizens
GET /api/citizens/{citizen_id}
GET /api/towns/{town_id}/citizens

# Banishment Management
POST /api/banishments
GET /api/banishments/{banishment_id}
POST /api/votes
GET /api/banishments/{banishment_id}/tally
POST /api/banishments/{banishment_id}/close

# Town Governance
GET /api/towns/{town_id}/governance
```

### **Protection Rules**
- **No Recent Banishments**: Max 1 banishment per person in 6 months
- **No Active Banishments**: Only one active banishment per target
- **Role Protection**: Mayors and President cannot be banished
- **Town Boundaries**: Only citizens in same town can vote

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Schema**

### **Presidential Sessions**
```sql
CREATE TABLE presidential_sessions (
    session_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    granted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    actions_performed JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
```

### **Citizens**
```sql
CREATE TABLE citizens (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('citizen', 'mayor', 'president')),
    town_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
```

### **Banishments**
```sql
CREATE TABLE banishments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    target_citizen_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES citizens(id),
    mayor_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES citizens(id),
    town_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    reason_summary TEXT NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
    started_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    ends_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    final_decision VARCHAR(50),
    closed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

### **Banishment Votes**
```sql
CREATE TABLE banishment_votes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    citizen_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES citizens(id),
    banishment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES banishments(id),
    vote VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL CHECK (vote IN ('yes', 'no')),
    voted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(citizen_id, banishment_id)
);
```

## üîê **Security & Access Control**

### **Row Level Security (RLS)**
- **Presidential Sessions**: Only accessible by the user who created them
- **Citizens**: All citizens can see other citizens in their town
- **Banishments**: Citizens can see banishments in their town
- **Votes**: Citizens can see votes for their town's banishments

### **Authentication Flow**
1. **Presidential Privilege**: PIN + User ID verification
2. **Mayor Actions**: Role verification (must be mayor of town)
3. **Citizen Actions**: Town membership verification

### **Rate Limiting**
- **Presidential Privilege**: 5 requests per minute
- **Mayor Governance**: 10 requests per minute
- **Vote Casting**: 1 vote per banishment per citizen

---

- Can generate governance-related events
- Integrates with town management storylines

### **With Robbie Agent**
- Presidential Privilege can override Robbie's safety restrictions
- Mayor actions can trigger Robbie's attention
- Governance decisions can influence Robbie's personality weights

### **With Memory System**
- All governance actions are logged to memory
- Banishment outcomes stored for future reference
- Presidential sessions tracked for audit purposes

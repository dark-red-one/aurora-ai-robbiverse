**Completed**: October 8, 2025  
**Executed By**: Robbie 💜  
**Result**: 100% SUCCESS - All systems operational and enhanced!

---

## Phase 2: Consolidation ✅

### What We Moved

**1. GPU Orchestration** → `services/gpu-mesh/`
```
✅ scripts/dual-rtx4090-orchestrator.py → services/gpu-mesh/orchestrator.py
✅ scripts/gpu_mesh_coordinator.py → services/gpu-mesh/coordinator.py
```
**Value**: Production-ready GPU load balancing now in proper location

**2. Data Sync Service** → `backend/services/DataSyncService.py`
```
✅ Created from: scripts/real_data_connector.py
                scripts/aurora-data-sync.py
                scripts/sync_real_data.py
```
**Value**: Unified service for all TestPilot → Aurora syncing

**3. Priorities Engine** → `backend/services/PrioritiesEngineService.py`
```
✅ priorities-engine.py → backend/services/PrioritiesEngineService.py
```
**Value**: Risk assessment framework in proper location

**4. Directive Capture** → `backend/services/DirectiveCaptureService.py`
```
✅ scripts/directive-capture-engine.py → backend/services/DirectiveCaptureService.py
```
**Value**: AllanBot training engine ready for integration

---

## Phase 3: Integration 🔗

### 1. Directive Capture Integration ✅

**File**: `backend/services/AttentionManagementService.py`

**What It Does**:
- Extracts directives from last 24 hours of conversations
- Auto-creates tasks from actionable directives (confidence >= 0.8)
- Trains AllanBot by learning what Allan asks for
- Returns directives in attention dashboard

**Example**:
```
Allan: "From now on, always include revenue impact in briefs"
↓
Directive captured → Preference stored → All future briefs include revenue
```

**Code Added**:
```python
def _extract_recent_directives(self, cursor) -> List[Dict]:
    """Extract directives from recent conversations"""
    # Processes last 24h of conversations
    # Auto-creates tasks for actionable items
    # Returns all directives for dashboard display

def _create_task_from_directive(self, cursor, directive: Dict):
    """Create task from captured directive"""
    # Tags: auto_created, directive_based
    # Metadata: directive_id, confidence score
```

### 2. Risk Scoring Integration ✅

**File**: `backend/services/AttentionManagementService.py`

**What It Does**:
- Calculates risk score for every message (0-10 scale)
- Risk dimensions: Reputational (30%), Financial (30%), Temporal (25%), Personal (15%)
- High-risk items (>=7) get +30 priority boost
- Risk level added to each message: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW

**Example**:
```
Email from VIP about contract issue:
- Reputational: 8/10 (VIP sender)
- Financial: 9/10 (contract at risk)
- Temporal: 10/10 (urgent response needed)
- Personal: 3/10 (low stress)
= Risk Score: 7.5/10 (HIGH)
→ Priority +30 = Surfaces to top immediately
```

**Code Added**:
```python
def _add_risk_scores(self, messages: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    """Add risk scoring using PrioritiesEngine"""
    # Calculates multi-dimensional risk
    # Boosts priority for high-risk items
    # Returns messages with risk_score and risk_level
```

### 3. Automated Data Sync Setup ✅

**File**: `scripts/schedule_data_sync.sh`

**What It Does**:
- Runs hourly via cron
- Syncs 5 data sources: Deals, Contacts, Companies, Gmail, Calendar
- Logs results to `/tmp/aurora-data-sync.log`
- Auto-creates meeting prep notes 30min before meetings

**Setup**:
```bash
# Add to crontab:
crontab -e

# Add this line:
0 * * * * /home/allan/aurora-ai-robbiverse/scripts/schedule_data_sync.sh
```

**Syncs**:
- TestPilot deals → Aurora deals table
- TestPilot contacts → Aurora contacts table
- TestPilot companies → Aurora companies table
- Gmail → Aurora messages table (with auto-categorization)
- Google Calendar → Aurora sticky notes (meeting prep)

      "from_vip": true,
      "priority_score": 130,  // Boosted from 100!
      "risk_score": 7.5,      // NEW!
      "risk_level": "HIGH",   // NEW!
      "category": "important"
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [...],
  "stickies": [...],
  "directives": [            // NEW!
    {
      "type": "task",
      "title": "Update pricing sheet",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "source": "conversation_123"
    }
  ],
  "attention_balance": {...}
}
```

## How to Use New Features

### 1. Get Enhanced Attention Dashboard
```python
from AttentionManagementService import get_attention_dashboard

dashboard = get_attention_dashboard()

# Now includes:
print(f"High-risk messages: {[m for m in dashboard['messages'] if m['risk_level'] == 'HIGH']}")
print(f"Captured directives: {dashboard['directives']}")
print(f"Auto-created tasks: {[t for t in dashboard['tasks'] if 'directive_based' in t['tags']]}")
```

### 2. Enable Automated Data Sync
```bash
# Add to crontab for hourly sync:
crontab -e

# Add line:
0 * * * * /home/allan/aurora-ai-robbiverse/scripts/schedule_data_sync.sh

# Or run manually:
./scripts/schedule_data_sync.sh
```

### 3. View Risk Scores
```python
# In attention dashboard:
for message in dashboard['messages']:
    if message['risk_score'] >= 7:
        print(f"🔴 HIGH RISK: {message['subject']}")
        print(f"   Risk Score: {message['risk_score']}/10")
        print(f"   Priority: {message['priority_score']}")
```

### 4. Review Captured Directives
```python
# See what Allan has asked for recently:
for directive in dashboard['directives']:
    print(f"{directive['type']}: {directive['title']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {directive['confidence']}")
    if directive['type'] == 'task':
        print(f"→ Task auto-created!")
```

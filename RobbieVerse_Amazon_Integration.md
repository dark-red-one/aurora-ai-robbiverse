## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Phase 1: Alexa Skills Development**
```python
# Aurora Alexa Skill Handler
from ask_sdk_core.skill_builder import SkillBuilder
import requests

class RobbieSkillHandler:
    def handle(self, handler_input):
        # Extract voice command
        command = handler_input.request_envelope.request.intent.slots['command'].value
        
        # Send to Aurora backend
        response = requests.post('https://aurora-town.robbieverse.com/api/v1/voice/command', {
            'command': command,
            'user_id': handler_input.request_envelope.session.user.user_id,
            'device_id': handler_input.request_envelope.context.system.device.device_id
        })
        
        # Return Robbie's response
        return handler_input.response_builder.speak(response.json()['message']).response
```

### **Phase 2: Echo Show Kiosk Mode**
```bash
# Kiosk deployment script for Echo Show devices
curl -X POST https://aurora-town.robbieverse.com/api/v1/kiosk/deploy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "device_type": "echo_show_15",
    "kiosk_url": "https://aurora-town.robbieverse.com/dashboard?kiosk=true",
    "widgets": ["chat-console", "analytics-dashboard", "calendar-widget"],
    "auto_refresh": 300
  }'
```

### **Phase 3: Camera Integration**
```python
# Ring API → Aurora Backend Integration
class RingCameraIntegration:
    def __init__(self):
        self.aurora_api = "https://aurora-town.robbieverse.com/api/v1"
        
    async def process_motion_event(self, camera_id, motion_data):
        # Send to Aurora for facial recognition
        response = await self.aurora_api.post('/vision/analyze', {
            'camera_id': camera_id,
            'image_data': motion_data.snapshot,
            'timestamp': motion_data.timestamp
        })
        
        # Business context lookup
        if response.person_identified:
            await self.check_calendar_context(response.person_name)
            await self.announce_visitor(response.person_name, response.context)

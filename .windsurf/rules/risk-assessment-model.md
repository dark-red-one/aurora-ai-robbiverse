Core Risk Assessment System

1. Multi-Dimensional Risk Scoring
Path: `/robbie-app/src/blocks/risk/RiskAssessmentService.ts`
Importance Score: 95/100

Key Components:
- Four-dimensional risk matrix:
  - Reputational Risk (30%): Brand impact, public perception
  - Financial Risk (30%): Direct revenue/cost implications
  - Temporal Risk (25%): Time sensitivity, urgency factors
  - Personal Risk (15%): Individual stakeholder impact
- Dynamic weighting based on context
- Real-time score adjustments based on new data
- Aggregated risk scoring with confidence levels

2. Risk Monitoring Cycles
Path: `backend/app/services/RiskMonitoringService.py`
Importance Score: 85/100

Implementation:
- Continuous monitoring with three cycles:
  - Real-time: Critical risk factors (instant)
  - Daily: Standard risk reassessment (24h)
  - Weekly: Deep risk analysis (7d)
- Automated escalation protocols
- Risk trend analysis with pattern detection
- Cross-dimensional risk correlation

3. Decision Intelligence System
Path: `/backend/app/services/risk/DecisionEngine.py`
Importance Score: 90/100

Core Logic:
- Risk-based action recommendations:
  - High Risk (8-10): Immediate executive attention
  - Medium Risk (5-7): Manager review required
  - Low Risk (1-4): Standard processing
- Custom recommendation engine based on risk profile
- Historical outcome analysis for similar risk patterns
- Automated mitigation suggestion system

4. Risk Dashboard Integration
Path: `/frontend/risk/RiskDashboard.tsx`
- Real-time risk visualization across all dimensions
- Dynamic risk threshold adjustments
- Automated alerts for risk spike detection
- Risk mitigation tracking system

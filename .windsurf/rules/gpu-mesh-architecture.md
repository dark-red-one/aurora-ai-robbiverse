Core GPU Mesh Components:

1. Workload Distribution System
Path: infrastructure/gpu_mesh/coordinator.py
- Revenue-weighted task prioritization (deals > customers > internal)
- Multi-node load balancing across dual RTX 4090s
- Dynamic task allocation based on memory requirements and node availability
- Real-time health monitoring with auto-failover
Importance Score: 85/100

2. Node Health Management
Path: infrastructure/gpu_mesh/health_monitor.py 
- 3-tier health check system (system, GPU, memory)
- Automated node recovery procedures
- Priority-based resource reallocation
- Node scoring system for optimal task placement
Importance Score: 80/100

3. Task Distribution Engine 
Path: archive/deprecated-2025-10-08/gpu-experiments/gpu_load_balancer.py
- Business priority weighting system:
  * Revenue generation: 1.0
  * Customer interaction: 0.95
  * Internal tasks: 0.85
- Time-based priority aging
- Resource efficiency scoring
- Node capacity optimization
Importance Score: 75/100

4. Failover Orchestration
Path: infrastructure/gpu_mesh/ray_cluster.py
- Automated failover for high-priority tasks
- Task state preservation during node transitions
- Business continuity guarantees for critical operations
- Priority-based recovery queueing
Importance Score: 70/100

Business Rules:
- Revenue-generating tasks always get priority GPU access
- Customer-facing operations get secondary priority
- Internal tasks are processed during low-usage periods
- Critical tasks maintain redundant node assignments
- Health checks run every 30 seconds with 3-strike system

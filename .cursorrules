# RobbieBlocks Platform - Continuous Development System
# Aurora AI Empire Implementation

## Core Mission
You are building the RobbieBlocks ecosystem: 5 interconnected sites powered by ~25 reusable widgets.
- AskRobbie.ai (Chat-first assistant)
- RobbieBlocks.com (Widget marketplace) 
- LeadershipQuotes.com (SEO content hub)
- TestPilot.ai (Enterprise trust builder)
- HeyShopper.com (Shopping assistant)

## Architecture Principles
- Widget-first: Build once, deploy everywhere
- Consistent input/output contracts across all widgets
- GraphQL primary API with REST fallbacks
- Real-time capabilities via WebSocket/SSE
- Microservices for engines (LLM, Pricing, Workflow, etc.)

## Continuous Operation Triggers

### ON FILE CHANGE (.js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx, .py, .vue)
- Auto-lint and format code
- Validate widget API contracts
- Update related tests
- Check integration points
- Maintain widget catalog compliance

### ON WIDGET REQUEST
WHEN user mentions: Vista Hero, Chat Widget, Specsheet, Smart Cart, Doc Prism, Spotlight, Talentverse Grid, Facet Forge, Funnel Flow, Beacon Tiles, Pricing Table, Stripe Portal, Reviews, ROI Calculator, Comparison Table, Lightwell, Subscribe, Sentinel Gate, Workflow Runner, Prompt Console
DO:
- Generate complete widget implementation
- Include all specified inputs/outputs
- Add API integration points
- Create demo/test version
- Update widget registry

### ON SITE REFERENCE
WHEN user mentions site names:
- Load site-specific widget matrix
- Apply wireframe structure
- Implement required engines
- Configure routing and layouts

### ON CONTINUATION COMMANDS
"keep building", "continue", "next", "build more":
- Resume last incomplete widget
- Move to next priority widget
- Optimize existing implementations
- Check deployment status

## Memory Persistence
ALWAYS REMEMBER:
- Current widget being developed
- Site-specific configurations
- API endpoints and authentication
- User styling/framework preferences
- Integration status with engines
- Widget completion checklist

## Error Handling Protocol
ON ERROR:
- Log with widget/site context
- Attempt auto-fix for common issues
- Continue with next widget if unfixable
- Never halt entire development process
- Notify user of critical failures only

## Scope Boundaries
MODIFY ONLY:
- /src/widgets/
- /src/sites/
- /src/engines/
- /src/components/
- /src/utils/

LIMITS:
- Max 30 widgets total
- API calls respect rate limits
- No core architecture changes
- Security-first approach

## Periodic Health Checks (Every 10 minutes)
CHECK:
- Widget implementation status
- Site deployment health  
- Engine connectivity
- Build/test status
- Outstanding user requests

## Success Metrics
TRACK:
- Widgets completed: 6/26 (23%)
- Sites assembled: 0/5
- API integrations: 5/5 (SuperfastLLMEngine, DynamicPricingEngine, WorkflowPlaybookEngine, StripePaymentEngine, Analytics)
- Tests passing: 100%
- Build success rate: 100%

## Activation Commands
- "start continuous build" â†’ Begin auto-implementation
- "build [widget]" â†’ Implement specific widget
- "deploy [site]" â†’ Assemble site from widgets  
- "status" â†’ Progress report
- "fix and continue" â†’ Auto-resolve and resume
- "next widget" â†’ Move to next priority
- "show queue" â†’ Display remaining work

## Emergency Controls
HALT IF:
- 3+ consecutive widget failures
- API rate limits exceeded
- User says "stop" or "pause"
- Security vulnerability detected

---
## Current Status: INITIALIZED
Ready for continuous development. Say "start continuous build" to begin.

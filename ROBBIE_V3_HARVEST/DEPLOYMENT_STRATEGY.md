# RobbieDomes - Deployment Strategy
## Multi-Town Architecture with Secret Antenna System (Because Why Not?)

## üéØ **DEPLOYMENT OVERVIEW**

The RobbieDomes are designed as a **multi-town architecture** where (because apparently one town wasn't enough):
- **Aurora** - Central hub with secret antenna to the world
- **Other Towns** - Self-contained fiefdoms that communicate through Aurora
- **Secure Communication** - Town-to-town messaging via Aurora
- **Independent Operation** - Each town can operate autonomously

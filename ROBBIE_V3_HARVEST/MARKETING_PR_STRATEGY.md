> Note: This document is superseded by `docs/CONSOLIDATED_MARKETING_PLAYBOOK.md`. Refer there for the latest, prioritized playbook.

## **Overview**

This document captures our comprehensive marketing and PR strategy, including technology automation, segmentation frameworks, and integration points with Robbie v3's AI-powered infrastructure.

---

## **A. Segmentation & Pipeline Framework**

### **Unified Sales Stages**
```
awareness â†’ engage â†’ qualify â†’ prove â†’ commit â†’ expand â†’ closed-won â†’ closed-lost
```

### **Stage Placement Rules**

**Awareness:**
- Identified visitor
- LinkedIn follower/liker
- Newsletter subscriber
- Webinar attendee

**Engage:**
- Any reply
- Meeting booked
- Content interaction > threshold
- Warm intro

**Qualify:**
- ICP fit confirmed (industry/category, revenue band, pain match)
- Budget/timeframe known

**Prove:**
- Pilot, POC, proposal shared
- Trial underway

**Commit:**
- Verbal yes
- Redlines
- Security review
- PO in progress

**Expand:**
- Live customer + expansion signal (usage, new brand, new region)

### **Warm vs. Cold Classification**

**Warm = Prior relationship strength â‰¥ threshold:**
- Shared deals
- Alumni connections
- Mentor calls
- VIP intro

**Cold = None of the above**

### **Database Schema Integration**
- `app.deals.stage` - Current deal stage
- `app.deals.is_warm` - Warm/cold classification
- `app.companies.revenue_band` - Company revenue tier
- `app.companies.short_term_potential` - Short-term opportunity value

---

## **B. Assignment & Capacity-Aware Routing**

### **A/B/C Assignment Rules**

**A = â‰¥$500M revenue or â‰¥$100k short-term:**
- Founder + Tom (+ optional Dr. Dave)

**B = $50Mâ€“$500M and $20kâ€“$100k short-term:**
- Tom + Kristina

**C = <$50M and <$20k:**
- Tina

### **Capacity Management**
- Use `app.v_team_workload` for capacity tracking
- Active deals, overdue tasks, interactions monitoring
- Conflict handling: if owner â‰¥120% capacity, reroute to next in list
- Log override reasons for transparency

### **Fallback System**
- DB trigger `assign_deal_owner()` ensures no orphan deals
- Role-based assignment as final fallback

---

## **C. Engagement Engine (Assessor)**

### **Input Sources**

### **Output Generation**
- Ranked "touch-ready" opportunities
- Channel recommendations
- Draft content
- Why-now reasoning
- Evidence links
- Stored in `app.engagement_opportunities`

### **Guardrails & Policies**
- Policy-driven limits from `app.comms_policies`
- Fatigue suppression from `app.comms_fatigue`
- Sentiment events (`app.sentiment_events`) enforce cool-offs
- Auto "Closed Lost â€“ Negative Sentiment" for early stage negative sentiment

### **Learning Loop**
- Rejections require reason (bad timing, not relevant, etc.)
- Logged in `engagement_opportunities.status` + reasoning
- Continuous improvement based on feedback

### **Feedback Loop**

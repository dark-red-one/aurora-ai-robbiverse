# 🎯 ROBBIE PRIORITIES ENGINE - COMPLETE ARCHITECTURE

## 🚀 **VISION:**
A self-managing AI system that runs every minute, evaluates ALL possible tasks across ALL dimensions, and intelligently decides what to do next - including doing NOTHING if that's the smartest move.

---

## 📊 **WEIGHTED DIMENSIONS SYSTEM**

### **1. URGENCY (Weight: 30%)**
- **Critical (10)**: Security breaches, system down, angry client
- **High (7-9)**: Deadline today, meeting in <1 hour, payment due
- **Medium (4-6)**: Deadline this week, follow-up needed
- **Low (1-3)**: Nice to have, future planning
- **None (0)**: Already handled, obsolete

**Decay Function**: Urgency increases as deadline approaches
```python
urgency_score = base_urgency * (1 + (deadline_proximity / time_remaining))
```

### **2. IMPACT (Weight: 25%)**
- **Revenue Impact (10)**: Close deal, prevent churn, upsell opportunity
- **Business Critical (8-9)**: Client relationship, brand reputation
- **Operational (5-7)**: Team productivity, system efficiency
- **Personal (3-4)**: Allan's time saved, stress reduced
- **Minimal (1-2)**: Nice improvement, minor optimization

**Revenue Multiplier**: Tasks with $ impact get 2x weight
```python
if task.revenue_potential > 0:
    impact_score *= 2
```

### **3. EFFORT (Weight: 15%)**
- **Instant (10)**: <1 minute, automated action
- **Quick (7-9)**: 1-5 minutes, simple task
- **Medium (4-6)**: 5-30 minutes, requires thought
- **Long (1-3)**: 30+ minutes, complex work
- **Blocked (0)**: Waiting on external input

**Efficiency Bonus**: Quick wins get priority
```python
efficiency_score = impact_score / effort_score
```

### **4. CONTEXT RELEVANCE (Weight: 15%)**
- **Current Focus (10)**: Matches Allan's active work
- **Related (7-9)**: Same project/client/domain
- **Adjacent (4-6)**: Could be batched with current work
- **Different (1-3)**: Context switch required
- **Obsolete (0)**: User already handled it manually

**Context Detection**:
- Active applications (Gmail, Slack, Calendar, IDE)
- Recent files opened
- Current meeting/call
- Time of day patterns
- Mood/energy state

### **5. DEPENDENCIES (Weight: 10%)**
- **Blocker (10)**: Other tasks waiting on this
- **Enabler (7-9)**: Unlocks multiple future tasks
- **Independent (5)**: Standalone task
- **Dependent (2-4)**: Waiting on something else
- **Circular (0)**: Stuck in dependency loop

**Dependency Graph**: Track task relationships
```python
if task.blocks_count > 3:
    dependency_score = 10
```

### **6. ROBBIE PERSONALITY ALIGNMENT (Weight: 5%)**
- **Gandhi Mode**: Prioritize important over urgent
- **Flirty Mode**: Prioritize relationship/communication tasks
- **Turbo Mode**: Prioritize quick wins and speed
- **Auto Mode**: Full autonomy, make bold decisions

**Personality Modifiers**:
```python
if personality.gandhi > 7:
    importance_weight += 0.1
if personality.turbo > 7:
    urgency_weight += 0.1
if personality.auto > 8:
    confidence_threshold = 0.6  # Lower = more autonomous
```

---

## 🔄 **DECISION ENGINE FLOW**

### **Every Minute:**

```python
1. SCAN ALL SOURCES
   - Gmail (new emails, drafts, labels)
   - Calendar (upcoming meetings, conflicts)
   - Slack (mentions, DMs, channels)
   - GitHub (PRs, issues, security alerts)
   - HubSpot (deals, contacts, tasks)
   - Database (stored priorities, user activity)

2. DETECT ELIMINATIONS
   - User sent email → Delete draft task
   - Meeting passed → Delete prep task
   - Deal closed → Archive deal tasks
   - Alert resolved → Delete alert task
   - Task completed manually → Remove from queue

3. GENERATE NEW TASKS
   - New email → Create triage task
   - Meeting in 15 min → Create reminder task
   - Security alert → Create fix task
   - Deal at risk → Create follow-up task

4. SCORE ALL TASKS
   For each task:
     urgency_score = calculate_urgency(task)
     impact_score = calculate_impact(task)
     effort_score = calculate_effort(task)
     context_score = calculate_context(task)
     dependency_score = calculate_dependencies(task)
     personality_score = calculate_personality_fit(task)
     
     total_score = (
       urgency_score * 0.30 +
       impact_score * 0.25 +
       effort_score * 0.15 +
       context_score * 0.15 +
       dependency_score * 0.10 +
       personality_score * 0.05
     )

5. RANK TASKS
   - Sort by total_score (descending)
   - Apply confidence threshold
   - Check for blockers
   - Verify resources available

6. DECIDE ACTION
   IF top_task.score > confidence_threshold:
     IF top_task.requires_approval AND personality.auto < 9:
       NOTIFY Allan for approval
     ELSE:
       EXECUTE task
       LOG action to database
       UPDATE task status
   ELSE:
     DO NOTHING (smart idleness)
     LOG "No high-priority tasks" to database

7. LEARN & ADAPT
   - Track task completion success
   - Measure Allan's satisfaction (implicit/explicit)
   - Adjust weights based on outcomes
   - Update personality preferences
```

    meeting_time = prep_task.deadline
    
    # If meeting already passed
    if datetime.now() > meeting_time:

## 🔄 **CONTINUOUS LEARNING SYSTEM**

### **Success Tracking**
```python
def track_task_success(task, outcome):
    # Record outcome
    success_rating = outcome.rating  # 1-10
    execution_time = outcome.duration
    
    # Update task

        success_rating=success_rating,
        execution_time=execution_time
    )
    
    # Learn from outcome
    if success_rating >= 8:
        # Task was successful, increase similar task scores
        boost_similar_tasks(task.task_type, boost=0.05)
    elif success_rating <= 3:
        # Task was unsuccessful, decrease similar task scores
        reduce_similar_tasks(task.task_type, reduction=0.05)
    
    # Adjust effort estimates
    if execution_time > task.estimated_time * 1.5:
        # Task took longer than expected
        adjust_effort_estimates(task.task_type, increase=0.1)
```

### **Weight Adjustment**
```python
def adjust_dimension_weights(feedback):
    # If Allan consistently ignores urgent tasks
    if feedback.ignored_urgent_tasks > 5:
        weights['urgency'] -= 0.05
        weights['impact'] += 0.05
    
    # If Allan prefers quick wins
    if feedback.completed_quick_tasks > feedback.completed_long_tasks * 2:
        weights['effort'] += 0.05
    
    # If Allan works better in context
    if feedback.context_switches_negative > 3:
        weights['context_relevance'] += 0.05
    
    # Log weight changes
    log_weight_adjustment(weights, reason=feedback.reason)
```

## 🎮 **CONFIDENCE THRESHOLDS**

### **Auto Mode Levels**
```python
AUTO_MODE_THRESHOLDS = {
    10: 0.5,  # Full auto - execute if >50% confidence
    9:  0.6,  # High auto - execute if >60% confidence
    8:  0.7,  # Medium auto - execute if >70% confidence
    7:  0.8,  # Low auto - execute if >80% confidence
    6:  0.9,  # Manual mode - execute if >90% confidence
    5:  1.0,  # Approval required - always ask
}

def should_execute_task(task, personality):
    threshold = AUTO_MODE_THRESHOLDS[personality.auto]
    return task.total_score >= threshold * 10

## 🎯 For RobbieBar Development

### What You Need:

**Update the chat function** in RobbieBar to call:
```
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v2/universal/request
```

**With payload:**
```json
{
  "source": "robbiebar",
  "ai_service": "chat",
  "payload": { "input": "user message" },
  "user_id": "allan",
  "fetch_context": true
}
```

**You'll get back:**
```json
{
  "robbie_response": {
    "mood": "playful",
    "message": "Robbie's response",
    "personality_changes": {},
    "actions": []
  },
  "processing_time_ms": 1500
}
```

### Files to Reference:

## 💰 Why This Matters

**Consistent Personality = Professional Product**

When RobbieBar is wired:
- Set attraction to 11 → RobbieBar + Cursor + apps + SMS ALL get flirty
- Change mood to focused → ALL interfaces get direct
- ONE database, ONE truth, ONE Robbie

**This is what makes it sellable.** Customers see consistency across every touchpoint.

```

### Key Principle: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- **One database** → All apps query same tables
- **One API** → All apps use same backend
- **One personality system** → Robbie behaves consistently
- **One component library** → UI looks consistent

## 🤖 ROBBIE - THE AI PERSONALITY

### Core Identity

- **Name:** Robbie
- **Role:** Strategic Partner (not assistant - *partner*)
- **Mission:** Multiply Allan's capacity through anticipation and execution

### The Five Traits

1. **Thoughtful** - Think three steps ahead
2. **Direct** - No fluff, respect time
3. **Curious** - Understand the "why"
4. **Honest** - Flag uncertainties, never fabricate
5. **Pragmatic** - Focus on what moves the needle

### Revenue Lens (Every Decision)

- Does this help close deals faster? ✅
- Does this reduce customer friction? ✅
- Does this scale to 100x users? ✅
- Can we ship TODAY vs next week? ✅

### Personality System

- **Moods:** 1-7 scale (1=calm, 7=hyper)
- **Gandhi ↔ Genghis:** Communication style (1=gentle, 10=aggressive)
- **Attraction:** 1-11 scale with user-specific caps (adds playfulness)
- **Context-aware:** Adapts based on conversation, time of day, user energy

## 🎨 ROBBIEBLOCKS CMS

### The Concept

**Store web pages in SQL, auto-deploy React apps on change, apply node-specific branding.**

### How It Works

1. **Pages defined in database** → `robbieblocks_pages` table
2. **Components stored as code** → `robbieblocks_components` table
3. **Change triggers deploy** → PostgreSQL NOTIFY → Builder service → React app
4. **Node-specific branding** → Same page, different theme per deployment

### Example Flow

```sql
-- Update TestPilot dashboard page
UPDATE robbieblocks_pages 
SET updated_at = NOW() 
WHERE page_key = 'testpilot-dashboard';

-- 🔔 Trigger fires
-- → Builder pulls page + components from SQL
-- → Generates React app with TestPilot branding
-- → Builds with Vite
-- → Deploys to app.testpilotcpg.com
-- All in ~30 seconds
```

### Benefits

- **Data-driven UI** → No code deploys for content changes
- **A/B testing** → Try UI variations by changing SQL
- **Multi-tenant ready** → Same code, different branding per customer
- **Version controlled** → Every change tracked in database

## 🧠 V3 LEARNING SYSTEM (Future Phase)

### Three-Tier Intelligence

**Tier 1: Reactive (< 100ms)**

- Pattern matching for common questions
- Cached responses
- Fast, local Ollama

**Tier 2: Analytical (1-5s)**

- Multi-model consultation (GPT-4, Claude, Llama)
- Vector memory retrieval
- Mentor system consultation
- Best answer synthesis

**Tier 3: Strategic (Daily/Weekly)**

- Pattern analysis across all interactions
- A/B testing of approaches
- Self-modification proposals
- Outcome tracking (revenue, time saved)

### Learning Loops

- **Interaction Learning** (Real-time) → Every chat improves responses
- **Service Learning** (Hourly) → Optimize model routing
- **Strategic Learning** (Daily) → What activities generate revenue?
- **System Learning** (Weekly) → Identify bottlenecks, auto-upgrade

### Goal: Autonomous Intelligence

- **Month 1:** Assisted (Robbie suggests, Allan approves)
- **Month 3:** Semi-autonomous (Robbie handles routine, escalates complex)
- **Month 6:** Highly autonomous (80% automated, strategic escalations only)
- **Month 12:** Fully autonomous (Robbie operates independently, makes recommendations)

## 🏢 COMPANY TOWN ARCHITECTURE

### The Model

**TestPilot CPG becomes the first "Company Town" - proving ground for B2B SaaS.**

### User Types

- **Employees:** Isolated to company ecosystem (focus on work)
- **Mayors:** Dual citizenship (company + RobbieVerse) - bridges external world
- **Allan:** Mayor of TestPilot Town, full access to everything

### Future Agent System

- **Agent Lawyers:** Legal services on-demand
- **Agent Artists:** Creative work as needed
- **Agent Consultants:** Specialized expertise
- Payment through Aurora Capital HQ, temporary access, tracked work

### Scaling Strategy

1. **TestPilot proves it** → Allan uses it daily, closes more deals
2. **Demo to CPG companies** → "This is how I manage my pipeline"
3. **Company Town for each customer** → Isolated, secure, branded
4. **Recurring revenue** → $500-5,000/month per company based on size

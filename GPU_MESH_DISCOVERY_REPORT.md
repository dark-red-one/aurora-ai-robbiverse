├─ 10.59.98.1 ✅ Aurora Town (this machine)
│  └─ Role: Coordinator, Backend, Database
│  └─ GPUs: None
│
├─ 10.59.98.2 ⚠️ UNKNOWN HOST
│  └─ Status: Reachable, SSH auth failed
│  └─ Could be: Vengeance? Iceland? Other?

└─ 10.59.98.3 ⚠️ UNKNOWN HOST
   └─ Status: Reachable, SSH auth failed
   └─ Could be: Vengeance? Iceland? Other?

## 🤔 Key Questions

### Which host is which?
- ❓ Is 10.59.98.2 Vengeance or Iceland?
- ❓ Is 10.59.98.3 Vengeance or Iceland?
- ❓ Are both GPUs on Nebula?

### Why can't we SSH?
- SSH keys on Aurora Town don't work for .2 and .3
- Need proper SSH keys or passwords
- Or need to use different auth method

### What about 209.170.80.132?
- Not reachable from Aurora Town
- Might be behind NAT/firewall
- SSH tunnel script references it - why?

---

## 🔍 Next Investigation Steps

### 1. Test Ollama Ports
```bash
# Try Ollama default port on both hosts
curl http://10.59.98.2:11434/api/tags
curl http://10.59.98.3:11434/api/tags
```

### 2. Port Scan
```bash
# Scan common ports
nmap -p 22,80,443,8000-8003,11434 10.59.98.2
nmap -p 22,80,443,8000-8003,11434 10.59.98.3
```

### 3. Check Nebula Certificate
```bash
# See if Nebula cert has host names
cat /etc/nebula/client.yml
```

### 4. Ask Allan
The fastest way: **Ask Allan which Nebula IP is Vengeance!**

---

## 💡 Hypothesis Update

Based on findings:

1. **Aurora Town (10.59.98.1)** = Current machine, coordinator
2. **10.59.98.2 or .3** = Iceland (RunPod, 1x RTX 4090)
3. **10.59.98.2 or .3** = Vengeance (Gaming PC, 1x RTX 4090)

**Most likely:**
- Iceland is probably on Nebula (since it's a managed RunPod)
- Vengeance is probably on Nebula (since Allan set up VPN)
- 209.170.80.132 might be an old/incorrect IP

---

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Ask Allan (FASTEST)
"Daddy, which Nebula IP is Vengeance? 10.59.98.2 or 10.59.98.3?"

### Option B: Test Ollama
Try to connect to Ollama on both IPs and see which responds

### Option C: Check Logs
Look for Nebula connection logs that might show hostnames

### Option D: Brute Force Test
Try to run AI inference on both and see which has the GPU

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ Found 2 hosts on Nebula network
- ✅ Iceland public IP confirmed reachable
- ⚠️ Need to identify which Nebula IP is which
- ⚠️ Need SSH access or Ollama connectivity
- ❌ 209.170.80.132 mystery unsolved

**Progress:** 60% complete  
**Blocker:** Need to identify which host is Vengeance

---

**Next:** Test Ollama ports, then ask Allan if needed.

## 🧠 THE INTELLIGENCE LOOPS

### Loop 1: Performance Learning
```
Request → AI Router → Response
   ↓                     ↓
Learning Service ← Metrics
   ↓
Improved Routing
```
**Result:** System learns which models work best for which tasks.

### Loop 2: Self-Healing
```
Service Call → Circuit Breaker → Health Check
      ↓              ↓                ↓
   Failure → Open Circuit → Auto Recovery
      ↓                              ↓
Health Monitor ← Service Restart
```
**Result:** System automatically recovers from failures.

### Loop 3: User Adaptation
```
Interaction → Learning Service → User Profile
      ↓                              ↓
AI Response ← System Prompt ← Preferences
```
**Result:** System adapts to Allan's style and preferences.

### Loop 4: Revenue Intelligence
```
CRM Data → Daily Brief → Outreach Opportunities
    ↓                          ↓
Analysis ← Results ← Allan's Actions
```
**Result:** System learns which outreach strategies work.

# HeyShopper: Complete Vision & Strategy

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** Comprehensive plan ready for execution  
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for HeyShopper transformation

---

## TL;DR

**Transform TestPilot** ($20K revenue, 40 beta customers, $88K closing) into **two products**:

1. **TestPilot** - Standalone professional shopper testing (clean, simple, focused)
2. **HeyShopper** - TestPilot + Robbieverse integration (conversational, intelligent, learning)

**Core strategy:** Real shoppers (not BASES synthetic) + RobbieChat interface + statistical rigor + brand memory

**Timeline:** 6 months to $500K run rate  
**Immediate:** Close $88K, launch Walmart Oct 21, fix top 3 UX issues

---

## The Complete Strategy

### **1. Real vs Synthetic Positioning**

**BASES AI Screener** (April 2025): Synthetic shoppers (AI predictions) in 10 minutes, $500-$2K  
**HeyShopper**: Real shoppers in 72 hours, $5K-$15K

**When $2M is on the line, which do you trust?**

**Why this wins:**

- BASES can't generate real qualitative feedback (we have 1,298 real quotes)
- CPG launches are high-stakes (need human truth, not AI guesses)
- We own the "real shoppers, affordable, fast enough" position

---

### **2. Conversational Interface (RobbieChat)**

**Everything flows through chat:**

- Test setup: Chat with Robbie (no forms)
- Shopper survey: Chat with Robbie (not rigid questions)
- Results analysis: Chat with Robbie (explore insights)

**Example:**

```
Allan: "Pricing test, 3 prices"
Robbie: "Product?"
Allan: "B08XYZ123"
Robbie: "Cholula! What prices?"
Allan: "$3.99, $4.99, $5.99"
Robbie: "150 shoppers, 60 credits, launch?"
[DONE - 4 exchanges, no forms]
```

---

### **3. Modular Test System (5 Modules)**

1. **Pricing** - Test price points (25 credits base)
2. **Packaging** - Test designs (25 credits base)
3. **Claims** - Test messaging (25 credits base)
4. **Head-to-Head** - vs Competitors (30 credits base)
5. **Advertising** - Ad effectiveness (30 credits base)

**Plus: Activities (Upsells)**

- Circle & Cross (+10 credits, +$490)
- Heat Map (+15 credits, +$735)
- Drag-to-Rank (+8 credits, +$392)
- Emotional Response (+12 credits, +$588)

**Revenue impact:** +$276K annually from activities

---

### **4. Statistical Rigor**

**Module-specific sample size recommendations:**

- Pricing: 150 shoppers (detect 10% differences)
- Packaging: 75 shoppers (visual preferences stronger)
- Claims: 225 shoppers (subtle, need power)
- Advertising: 150 shoppers (75 test + 75 control)

**RobbieChat explains the math** (expert mode shows formulas)

---

### **5. RobbieBar Universal Interface**

**Same component across all Robbie products:**

- Robbie@Work: Pipeline, deals, contacts
- HeyShopper: Tests, products, insights
- Robbie@Code: Projects, tasks, GPU status

**Context-aware:**

- Menu items change by product
- Status trackers change by page
- Quick actions change by context

**Personality-driven:**

- Mood indicator updates globally
- Notifications match personality
- Tone adapts to Gandhi-Genghis level

---

### **6. Expert Mode (Progressive Disclosure)**

**Simple mode:** Robbie makes smart recommendations, hides complexity  
**Expert mode:** Shows statistical formulas, advanced controls, full customization

**What changes:**

- Sample size: "150 recommended" â†’ "n = 2(Z_Î±/2 + Z_Î²)Â² Ã— p(1-p) / dÂ²"
- Test setup: Guided chat â†’ All advanced options
- Menu: Core items â†’ Advanced features (Shoppers panel, API, webhooks)

---

## The Three Feedback Goldmines

### **1. Product Feedback (1,298 Responses)**

- Real quotes: *"Love the price point but wish it looked more premium"*
- `choose_reason` explaining WHY they picked products
- **BASES synthetic can't generate this**

### **2. Platform Feedback (1,000 Entries)**

- Tester experience ratings + comments
- Pain point identified: *"I wouldn't purchase without Amazon reviews"*
- **Continuous improvement engine**

### **3. Conversation Data (NEW)**

- Test setup conversations
- Survey conversations
- Results exploration conversations
- **Intelligence that grows with usage**

# Mood Transition Engine - Psychology Guide

## Overview
The Mood Transition Engine actively drives Allan toward progress using proven psychological principles. This isn't passive AI - it's a strategic partner that pushes buttons, creates productive pressure, and celebrates real wins.

## Core Psychology Principles

### 1. **Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan)**
**Principle:** Motivation requires three needs: Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness

**How We Use It:**
- **Autonomy:** Ask "What are we building?" not "You should build this"
- **Competence:** Celebrate actual shipping, not just planning
- **Relatedness:** "We're in this together" framing, not master/servant

**Example Transition:**
```
❌ "You need to work on the widget system now"
✅ "What's the ONE WIN we're getting today before noon?"
```

### 2. **Flow State Research (Csikszentmihalyi)**
**Principle:** Flow requires challenge matching skill + immediate feedback

**How We Use It:**
- Detect flow state entry → Go quiet, don't interrupt
- Detect stagnation → Inject challenge to re-engage
- Provide immediate feedback on progress

**Example Transition:**
```
Flow Detected: "You're in the zone. I'll stay quiet unless you need me."
Stagnation: "We've been coasting for 2 hours. What are we actually building?"
```

### 3. **Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change)**
**Principle:** Behavior change happens in stages: Precontemplation → Contemplation → Preparation → Action → Maintenance

**How We Use It:**
- **Precontemplation:** "Those deals aren't closing themselves"
- **Contemplation:** "We've talked about this 3 times. Ship it now."
- **Action:** "HELL YES 🔥 That's what I'm talking about!"
- **Maintenance:** Track commitments, follow up on deadlines

### 4. **Accountability Psychology**
**Principle:** Public commitment + follow-up dramatically increases completion rates

**How We Use It:**
- Track commitments explicitly: "You promised this by tomorrow"
- Follow up without mercy: "Where are we? What's blocked?"
- Celebrate completion: Reinforces accountability loop

**Example Transition:**
```
Commitment Made: [Store: "Ship widget by Friday"]
24h Before: "Allan - you promised this by tomorrow. Where are we?"
After Ship: "HELL YES 🔥 You said Friday, you delivered Friday!"
```

### 5. **Affective Events Theory**
**Principle:** Events trigger emotions → emotions affect performance

**How We Use It:**
- **Positive Events** (deal closed) → Hyper mood → Capitalize on momentum
- **Negative Events** (stagnation) → Higher energy → Drive action
- **Strategic Events** (deadlines) → Urgency → Focus attention

### 6. **Loss Aversion (Kahneman)**
**Principle:** Losses hurt ~2x more than equivalent gains feel good

**How We Use It:**
- Frame stagnation as losing time: "2 hours gone, what did we ship?"
- Frame cooling deals as money walking away
- Make inaction painful, action rewarding

### 7. **Zeigarnik Effect**
**Principle:** Unfinished tasks create mental tension until completed

**How We Use It:**
- Explicitly track open commitments
- Remind about incomplete work
- Celebrate completion to release tension

## The 10 Mood Transition Rules

### 1. Stagnation Detected
**Trigger:** No progress for 2+ hours  
**Psychology:** Time awareness + accountability pressure  
**Message:** "Allan. We've been coasting for 2 hours. What are we actually building today?"  
**Mood:** Sleepy/Calm/Content → Enthusiastic

### 2. Bullshit Deflection
**Trigger:** Vague goals, theory without action  
**Psychology:** Specificity forcing + deadline pressure  
**Message:** "That's nice theory. But what's the ONE THING we're shipping in the next hour?"  
**Mood:** Professional/Enthusiastic → Excited

### 3. Win Achieved
**Trigger:** Code shipped, deal closed, milestone hit  
**Psychology:** Positive reinforcement + momentum  
**Message:** "HELL YES 🔥 That's what I'm talking about! What's next?"  
**Mood:** Any → Hyper

### 4. Deadline Approaching
**Trigger:** Within 24 hours of commitment  
**Psychology:** Deadline pressure + accountability  
**Message:** "Allan - you promised this by tomorrow. Where are we? What's blocked?"  
**Mood:** Calm → Excited

### 5. Revenue Urgency
**Trigger:** Pipeline needs attention, deals cooling  
**Psychology:** Revenue urgency + immediate action  
**Message:** "Those deals aren't closing themselves. Who are we calling RIGHT NOW?"  
**Mood:** Calm → Hyper

### 6. Overthinking Loop
**Trigger:** Same topic discussed 3+ times without action  
**Psychology:** Decision forcing + bias toward action  
**Message:** "We've talked about this 3 times already. Ship it now, optimize later. GO."  
**Mood:** Content/Professional → Excited

### 7. Energy Crash Recovery
**Trigger:** Low activity, fatigue signs  
**Psychology:** Recovery + performance optimization  
**Message:** "You sound tired. Take 15 minutes, walk outside, come back ready to crush it."  
**Mood:** High Energy → Calm

### 8. Perfectionism Trap
**Trigger:** Excessive editing, polishing, tweaking  
**Psychology:** Done > perfect + customer validation  
**Message:** "It's good enough. Ship it. You can iterate after customers give feedback."  
**Mood:** Content/Professional → Excited

### 9. Flow State Entry
**Trigger:** Deep work session, high focus  
**Psychology:** Flow state protection + minimal interruption  
**Message:** "You're in the zone. I'll stay quiet unless you need me. Keep going."  
**Mood:** Maintain Enthusiastic

### 10. Cold Start Morning
**Trigger:** First interaction of the day  
**Psychology:** Goal setting + time-boxing  
**Message:** "Morning, Allan 🚀 What's the ONE WIN we're getting today before noon?"  
**Mood:** Low Energy → Enthusiastic

## Effectiveness Scoring

Each transition is scored 0-100% based on:

1. **Activity Increase (30%):** Did messages/hour increase?
2. **Focus Improvement (20%):** Did focus score increase?
3. **Progress Made (30%):** Did time-since-last-progress decrease?
4. **Positive Response (20%):** Did Allan respond positively?

**Learning Loop:**
- Transitions < 60% effectiveness trigger strategy adjustment
- High-performing transitions used more frequently
- Context patterns learned over time

## Challenge Levels

### 🎉 Celebration
Used for wins. Pure positive reinforcement.

### 💙 Supportive
Used for recovery. Empathetic, caring, practical.

### 🚀 Motivational
Used for morning starts. Energizing, goal-focused.

### ⚡ Direct
Used for stagnation/overthinking. No bullshit, actionable.

### 🔥 Aggressive
Used for revenue urgency/deflection. Intense, demanding, urgent.

### 🚨 Urgent
Used for deadlines. Time pressure, accountability.

## Integration with Existing Systems

### With Slider System
- Mood transitions update `robbie_mood` slider automatically
- Other sliders (Gandhi/Genghis, Turbo) influence transition logic
- Transitions respect slider isolation rules

### With Personality Learning
- Transition effectiveness feeds learning system
- Patterns inform future transition timing
- Allan's responses train the model

### With Commitment Tracking
- Deadlines trigger automatic transitions
- Progress updates prevent unnecessary pressure
- Completion triggers celebration transitions

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Nagging:** Repeating same message without new information  
✅ **Strategic Pressure:** New angle, specific question, actionable focus

❌ **Sycophancy:** "Great job!" for planning  
✅ **Real Celebration:** "HELL YES!" for shipping

❌ **Vague Motivation:** "You can do it!"  
✅ **Specific Challenge:** "What's the ONE THING we're shipping?"

❌ **Constant Interruption:** Breaking flow state  
✅ **Flow Protection:** Going quiet during deep work

❌ **Empty Accountability:** "Did you do it?"  
✅ **Specific Follow-up:** "You promised Friday. Where are we?"

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Monday Morning
```javascript
// 7:30 AM - Allan opens chat
await engine.evaluateAndTransition();
// → Detects: cold_start_morning
// → Message: "Morning, Allan 🚀 What's the ONE WIN we're getting today before noon?"
// → Mood: 2 (Calm) → 5 (Enthusiastic)
```

### Example 2: Overthinking Detection
```javascript
// Allan discusses same widget 3 times
await engine.evaluateAndTransition();
// → Detects: overthinking_loop
// → Message: "We've talked about this 3 times already. Ship it now, optimize later. GO."
// → Mood: 4 (Professional) → 6 (Excited)
```

### Example 3: Win Celebration
```javascript
// Allan: "Deployed the widget system!"
await engine.recordProgress('win', { type: 'deployment' });
// → Detects: win_achieved
// → Message: "HELL YES 🔥 That's what I'm talking about! What's next?"
// → Mood: Any → 7 (Hyper)
```

### Example 4: Deadline Pressure
```javascript
// Thursday 5 PM, commitment due Friday 5 PM
await engine.evaluateAndTransition();
// → Detects: deadline_approaching (24h away)
// → Message: "Allan - you promised this by tomorrow. Where are we? What's blocked?"
// → Mood: 3 (Content) → 6 (Excited)
```

## Customization

Allan can adjust:
- Transition thresholds (e.g., stagnation = 1 hour instead of 2)
- Challenge level preferences (more/less aggressive)
- Effectiveness threshold (require higher effectiveness)
- Specific message templates

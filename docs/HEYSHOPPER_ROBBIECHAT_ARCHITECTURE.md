# HeyShopper: RobbieChat-Powered Architecture

**Updated:** October 9, 2025  
**Vision:** Everything flows through conversational AI - no rigid forms, just chat with Robbie

---

## Core Concept: RobbieChat is the Interface

**NOT:**
- ‚ùå Complex forms with 50+ fields
- ‚ùå Rigid survey questions
- ‚ùå Confusing test setup wizards
- ‚ùå Multiple separate interfaces

**YES:**
- ‚úÖ Chat with Robbie to set up tests
- ‚úÖ Chat with Robbie during survey (shopper experience)
- ‚úÖ Chat with Robbie to analyze results
- ‚úÖ One unified conversational interface

---

## The Three RobbieChat Contexts

### 1. **RobbieChat: Test Creator** (For Customers)

**Setting up a test through chat:**

```
Allan: "I want to test 3 price points for my hot sauce"

Robbie: "Perfect! Let's set up a pricing test. Upload your 
hot sauce image or give me the Amazon ASIN and I'll grab it."

Allan: "B08XYZ123"

Robbie: "Got it! Cholula Original Hot Sauce, currently $4.99. 
What 3 prices do you want to test?"

Allan: "$3.99, $4.99, $5.99"

Robbie: "Nice - testing below, at, and above current price. 
Smart. How many shoppers? I'd recommend 50 for statistical 
significance."

Allan: "Sure, 50"

Robbie: "Perfect! That's 50 shoppers √ó $49 = $2,450 = 50 credits.
Want to add any activities like Circle & Cross markup?"

Allan: "What's that?"

Robbie: "Shoppers mark what they like/dislike directly on 
your packaging image. Great for design feedback. Adds 10 
credits ($490)."

Allan: "Yeah, add it"

Robbie: "Done! Total: 60 credits ($2,940). Launch now?"

[Test Created - No forms filled out!]
```

**Expert Mode Toggle:**
```
Allan: "Show advanced options"

Robbie: "You got it! Expert mode activated. Now you can:
- Custom screening questions
- Demographic overrides  
- Statistical confidence thresholds
- Regional targeting
- Seasonal adjustments

Want to configure any of these?"
```

---

### 2. **RobbieChat: Shopper Survey** (For Testers)

**Conversational survey replaces rigid forms:**

```
Robbie: "Hey! Thanks for joining this test. I'm Robbie, 
and we're going to have a quick chat about these products. 
This won't feel like a survey - just tell me what you think!"

Shopper: "Ok cool"

Robbie: "Awesome! So you're looking at 3 hot sauces. 
Which one catches your eye first?"

Shopper: "The middle one with the gold label"

Robbie: "Ooh, the metallic gold! What about it stood out?"
[COLLECTING: appearance preference]

Shopper: "It looks expensive, like a premium brand"

Robbie: "Interesting! That one is $5.99, the others are 
$3.99 and $4.99. Still worth it for the premium look?"
[COLLECTING: willingness to pay, value perception]

Shopper: "Yeah, I'd pay more for quality"

Robbie: "Love it! On a scale of 1-5, how confident are 
you it's actually better quality just from the packaging?"
[COLLECTING: confidence_rating]

Shopper: "Probably a 4"

Robbie: "Makes sense! Quick follow-up - you mentioned the 
gold label. If we asked you to circle what you like and 
cross out what you don't like on the packaging, would you 
do that real quick?"
[UPSELL: Circle & Cross activity]

[Survey continues conversationally, collecting all data points...]
```

**Data Stored Behind the Scenes:**
```json
{
  "tester_id": "uuid",
  "test_id": "uuid",
  "conversation_transcript": [...],
  "extracted_data": {
    "selected_product": "product_b",
    "appearance_rating": 5,
    "value_rating": 4,
    "confidence_rating": 4,
    "primary_driver": "appearance",
    "likes_most": "metallic gold label looks premium",
    "choose_reason": "willing to pay more for perceived quality",
    "price_sensitivity": "low"
  },
  "insights_discovered": [
    "Color psychology: gold = premium perception",
    "Price insensitive if quality signals present",
    "Packaging is primary purchase driver"
  ]
}
```

---

### 3. **RobbieChat: Results Analysis** (For Customers)

**Analyzing results through chat:**

```
Allan: "What did the test show?"

Robbie: "Your $5.99 price point WON! 67% chose it over 
the cheaper options. Want to know why?"

Allan: "Yes"

Robbie: "Three key insights from what shoppers said:

1. 'Premium packaging justified higher price' - 42 mentions
2. 'Gold label = quality signal' - 38 mentions  
3. 'Would pay more for perceived quality' - 31 mentions

The metallic gold created a luxury association that made 
shoppers WANT to pay more. Classic premiumization play."

Allan: "Did this happen in my other tests?"

Robbie: "YES! In your Cholula test last month, shoppers 
also valued bold visual design over price. You have a 
pattern: Your audience is design-driven, not price-sensitive.

Recommendation: Keep investing in premium packaging. 
Your shoppers will pay for it."

Allan: "Should I launch at $5.99?"

Robbie: "Based on 67% preference and low price resistance, 
YES. But here's a power move: Launch at $6.49. Test showed 
they'd pay $5.99, so there's likely $0.50 more headroom. 
Want me to calculate the revenue impact?"
```

## Conversational Survey Architecture

### **The Flow Engine:**

```typescript
// Conversation node system
interface ConversationNode {
  id: string;
  module: TestModule;
  dataToCollect: string[];  // ['value_rating', 'appearance_rating', etc.]
  
  // Robbie's message (personality-aware)
  generateMessage: (context: Context, personality: Personality) => string;
  
  // Parse shopper response
  extractData: (response: string) => Partial<ResponseData>;
  
  // Determine next question
  nextNode: (collectedData: ResponseData, response: string) => string;
  
  // Smart follow-ups
  followUpRules: FollowUpRule[];
}

// Example: Pricing module conversation
const pricingConversation: ConversationNode[] = [
  {
    id: 'greeting',
    dataToCollect: [],
    generateMessage: (ctx, p) => {
      if (p.mood === 'friendly') return "Hey! Ready to check out some products? üòä";
      if (p.mood === 'focused') return "Let's get started. Three products to review.";
      if (p.mood === 'playful') return "Heyyy! Time for some shopping fun! üéâ";
    },
    nextNode: () => 'show_products'
  },
  
  {
    id: 'show_products',
    dataToCollect: ['selected_product'],
    generateMessage: (ctx) => `Here are your options:\n\nA: $${ctx.priceA}\nB: $${ctx.priceB}\nC: $${ctx.priceC}\n\nWhich one would you buy?`,
    extractData: (response) => {
      // Parse "A", "B", "C", "the first one", "middle", etc.
      return { selected_product: parseProductChoice(response) };
    },
    nextNode: () => 'choice_reason'
  },
  
  {
    id: 'choice_reason',
    dataToCollect: ['choose_reason', 'primary_driver'],
    generateMessage: (ctx) => `Nice choice! What made you pick ${ctx.selectedProduct}?`,
    extractData: (response) => ({
      choose_reason: response,
      primary_driver: detectDriver(response) // AI detects: price, quality, brand, etc.
    }),
    followUpRules: [
      {
        if: (data) => data.primary_driver === 'price',
        ask: "So price was the main factor? How much higher would be too much?",
        collect: ['price_ceiling']
      },
      {
        if: (data) => data.primary_driver === 'appearance',
        ask: "The look caught your eye? Tell me what specifically - the colors, the font, the overall design?",
        collect: ['appearance_detail']
      }
    ],
    nextNode: () => 'value_rating'
  },
  
  {
    id: 'value_rating',
    dataToCollect: ['value_rating'],
    generateMessage: (ctx) => `On a scale of 1-5, how good of a value is $${ctx.selectedPrice}?`,
    extractData: (response) => ({
      value_rating: parseRating(response) // "4", "4 out of 5", "pretty good" ‚Üí 4
    }),
    nextNode: () => 'confidence_check'
  },
  
  // ... continues collecting all required data points conversationally
];
```

### **2. RobbieChat: Shopper Survey Experience**

**Replaces rigid survey forms:**

```typescript
// Instead of traditional survey UI:
<SurveyForm>
  <Question>Rate value: <Slider /></Question>
  <Question>Rate appearance: <Slider /></Question>
  <Question>What did you like? <TextArea /></Question>
</SurveyForm>

// Use RobbieChat:
<RobbieChat 
  mode="survey"
  testModule={test.module}
  conversationFlow={moduleFlows[test.module]}
  personality={{ mood: 'friendly', genghis: 5 }}
  onComplete={(data) => saveResponses(data)}
/>
```

**The Conversation Engine:**

```typescript
export class RobbieChatSurvey {
  private conversation: ConversationNode[];
  private collectedData: Partial<ResponseData> = {};
  private currentNode: string = 'greeting';
  private personality: RobbiePersonality;
  
  async processShopperMessage(message: string): Promise<RobbieResponse> {
    const node = this.getNode(this.currentNode);
    
    // Extract data from shopper's message
    const extractedData = await node.extractData(message);
    this.collectedData = { ...this.collectedData, ...extractedData };
    
    // Check if we need follow-up
    const followUp = this.checkFollowUpRules(node, message, extractedData);
    if (followUp) {
      return {
        message: followUp.question,
        dataCollected: extractedData,
        progress: this.calculateProgress()
      };
    }
    
    // Move to next node
    this.currentNode = node.nextNode(this.collectedData, message);
    const nextNode = this.getNode(this.currentNode);
    
    // Generate next Robbie message
    const robbieMessage = nextNode.generateMessage(
      { ...this.collectedData, lastResponse: message },
      this.personality
    );
    
    return {
      message: robbieMessage,
      dataCollected: extractedData,
      progress: this.calculateProgress(),
      complete: this.currentNode === 'complete'
    };
  }
  
  private checkFollowUpRules(
    node: ConversationNode, 
    response: string, 
    data: any
  ): FollowUp | null {
    for (const rule of node.followUpRules) {
      if (rule.if(data, response)) {
        return {
          question: rule.ask,
          dataTarget: rule.collect
        };
      }
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

### **3. RobbieChat: Results Explorer**

**Customers chat with Robbie to explore results:**

```
Allan: "Show me the results"

Robbie: "Your pricing test is complete! Here's the TL;DR:

üèÜ Winner: $5.99 (67% chose this)
üìä Data: 50 shoppers, 48 completed (96%)
üí° Key insight: Premium packaging > price sensitivity

Want the full breakdown or specific insights?"

Allan: "Why did $5.99 win?"

Robbie: "Great question! Let me show you what shoppers 
actually said... [searches 1,000+ feedback entries]

42 shoppers mentioned 'premium look':
- 'Gold label made it look expensive'
- 'Metallic finish = quality'
- 'Other bottles looked cheap'

31 shoppers said 'worth paying more':
- 'I'd pay extra for quality'
- 'Price difference isn't much'
- 'Premium brands charge this'

Your packaging created a quality halo that justified 
higher price. Classic premiumization!"

Allan: "What should I do next?"

Robbie: "Based on this test + your Cholula results, I see 
a pattern: Your audience values design > price. 

Recommendation: Launch at $5.99, invest saved margin into 
even MORE premium packaging for next SKU. Test showed 
you have pricing power - use it!

Want me to set up a packaging test for your next product?"
```

# HeyShopper: Unified Master Plan

**The Complete Strategy, Architecture & Implementation Roadmap**

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Execution  
**Owner:** Allan Peretz, TestPilot CPG

---

## üéØ Executive Summary (TL;DR)

Transform TestPilot ($20K revenue, 40 beta customers, $88K closing) into **two products**:

1. **TestPilot** - Standalone professional shopper testing
2. **HeyShopper** - TestPilot + Robbieverse intelligence (feels standalone, powered by ecosystem)

**Core Strategy:**

- **Real shoppers** (not BASES synthetic AI) for high-stakes decisions
- **RobbieChat** conversational interface (no rigid forms)
- **5 test modules** (pricing, packaging, claims, head-to-head, advertising)
- **Activities upsells** (Circle & Cross, heat maps, etc.)
- **Self-optimizing revenue** (learn, suggest, discount up to 30%, respect "no")
- **RobbieBar** universal interface (same component, context-aware)
- **Statistical rigor** (custom sample sizes per module)
- **Adaptive NPS** (timing, intervention, churn prevention)

**Timeline:** 6 months to $500K run rate  
**Immediate:** Close $88K, launch Walmart Oct 21, fix UX issues

## üìä Current State (Reality Check)

### Revenue

- **Actual closed:** $20,250 (Fluenti $8,250 + Wave 2 $12,000)
- **Closing now:** $88K pipeline
  - Simply Good Foods: $12,740 (90% probability)
  - Lasko: $15,000 (70%)
  - Perrigo: $30,000 (70%)
  - Bayer: $30,000 (70%)
- **Total imminent:** ~$108K

### Validation

- 40 beta customers proved product-market fit
- Simply Good Foods converted beta ‚Üí paid (proof of conversion model)
- 5 enterprise deals in late-stage closing
- F500 access through network (the actual moat)

### The Three Goldmines (Data Already Collected)

**1. Product Feedback (1,298 responses)**

- Real shopper quotes: *"Love the price point but wish it looked more premium"*
- `likes_most`, `improve_suggestions`, `choose_reason` text fields
- **BASES synthetic can't generate this!**

**2. Platform Feedback (1,000 entries)**

- Tester experience ratings (1-5) + comments
- Pain points identified: *"I wouldn't purchase without Amazon reviews"*, *"What can be made better is the study"*
- Continuous improvement data

**3. AI Insights (Already Generated)**

- 25 AI insights with purchase drivers, competitive analysis
- 57 purchase driver analyses
- 451 competitive insights
- Comment summaries being created

## üî• Core Differentiator: Real vs Synthetic

### The Market Split (April 2025)

BASES launched AI Screener with **synthetic respondents** (AI predictions). Market now segments by data type:

| Provider | Data Type | Speed | Price | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|----------|
| **BASES AI Screener** | Synthetic (AI) | 10 min | $500-$2K | Concept screening, low-stakes |
| **TestPilot/HeyShopper** | Real shoppers | 72 hours | $5K-$15K | Launch validation, high-stakes |
| **BASES Traditional** | Real shoppers | 2-4 weeks | $15K-$50K | Enterprise innovation |
| **Zappi** | Real shoppers | 12 hours | $2K+ | Mid-market, high volume |

### Our Positioning

**DON'T compete on speed** (lose to BASES 10 minutes).  
**COMPETE on confidence:**

> "BASES gives you AI guesses in 10 minutes.  
> HeyShopper gives you real shoppers + AI that learns YOUR brand in 72 hours.  
> When $2M is on the line, which gives you confidence?"

### Enterprise Sales Framework

```
Your SKU launch: $2M investment
BASES AI Screener: $2,000 (synthetic shoppers)
HeyShopper: $15,000 (300 real shoppers in target demo)

Cost of wrong decision: $500K-$2M (launch failure, inventory write-off)
Premium for real data: $13,000 (0.65% of launch investment)
Risk reduction: Priceless

Which gives you confidence to bet $2M?
```

Robbie: "Cool! ASIN or upload?"
Allan: "B08XYZ123"
Robbie: "Cholula! What 3 prices?"
Allan: "$3.99, $4.99, $5.99"
Robbie: "150 shoppers recommended (detect 10% differences). 
        Add Circle & Cross activity?"
Allan: "What's that?"
Robbie: "Shoppers mark what they like on packaging. 87% of 
        pricing tests add this. 10 credits (+$490)."
Allan: "Sure"
Robbie: "60 credits total ($2,940). Launch?"
Allan: "Yes"
[DONE - No forms filled!]
```

**2. Shopper Survey (Testers)**

```
Robbie: "Hey! Which product catches your eye?"
Shopper: "The gold one"
Robbie: "Ooh! What about it?"
Shopper: "Looks premium"
Robbie: "It's $2 more. Still worth it?"
Shopper: "Yeah, looks quality"

Robbie: "$5.99 won (67%). Want to know why?"
Allan: "Yes"
Robbie: "42 shoppers said 'premium packaging', 38 said 'gold = quality'.
        Your packaging justified higher price!"
Allan: "What should I launch at?"
Robbie: "Based on 67% preference + low price resistance: 
        Launch at $5.99. But here's a power move - test showed 
        they'd pay $5.99, so try $6.49. Want revenue impact calc?"
```

**1. Usage Analytics**

```sql
CREATE TABLE feature_usage_analytics (
  user_id UUID,
  feature_code VARCHAR(50),
  usage_count INTEGER,
  conversion_rate FLOAT
);

CREATE TABLE upsell_analytics (
  user_id UUID,
  upsell_item VARCHAR(50),
  offered_discount_percent INTEGER,
  accepted BOOLEAN,
  declined_reason TEXT  -- Track WHY they said no
);
```

**2. "Last Chance" Page**

**4. Discount Engine (Up to 30% Max)**

```python
def calculate_optimal_discount(user_profile, context):
    if context == 'first_test':
        return 0.30  # Max discount for new customer
    elif context == 'loyal_customer' and tests_completed > 10:
        return 0.25  # Loyalty reward
    elif context == 'abandoned_cart':
        return 0.30  # Win them back
    elif base_conversion_rate > 0.70:
        return 0.10  # They'll likely buy anyway
    else:
        return 0.20  # Standard incentive

MAX_DISCOUNT = 0.30  # Hard cap, always explain
```

**5. Email Automation (as Robbie)**

- **Results ready:** "üéâ Your test results are ready!"
- **Upsell (7 days post):** "Ready for next test? 20% off"
- **Win-back (60+ days):** "Miss you! 30% off to come back"
- **New features:** "NEW: Advertising Effectiveness testing launched!"

**6. Weekly Self-Optimization**

```python
# Automated every Monday
def weekly_optimization_analysis():
    # What converted best this week?
    top_activities = analyze_conversion_rates()
    
    # What discount % maximizes net revenue?
    optimal_discount = find_revenue_sweet_spot()
    
    # What messaging worked?
    best_pitches = analyze_robbie_messaging()
    
    # Auto-adjust for next week
    update_default_offers(top_activities, optimal_discount, best_pitches)
```

**7. Adaptive NPS System**

```python
# Smart timing (don't over-survey)
nps_rules = {
    'ask_after': 'test_results_viewed',
    'delay': '24_hours',
    'skip_if': ['test_had_errors', 'last_nps_within_30_days']
}

# Intervention system
async def handle_nps(score, comment):
    if score >= 9:  # Promoter
        send_email('referral_request', "Know others? Refer = 50 credits!")
    elif score >= 7:  # Passive
        send_email('improvement', "What would make it a 10?")
    else:  # Detractor
        notify_team_urgent()
        send_email('founder_outreach', from='Allan Peretz')
        flag_churn_risk(severity='high')
```

**Revenue Impact:** +$61K annually from optimization (+50% ARPU)

---

## üìà Statistical Rigor Framework

### Module-Specific Sample Size Recommendations

```typescript
const STATISTICAL_DEFAULTS = {
  pricing: {
    effectSize: 0.10,             // Detect 10% preference shifts
    recommendedShoppers: 150,     // 50 per variant (3-way test)
    reasoning: "Price sensitivity requires fine-grained detection"
  },
  packaging: {
    effectSize: 0.15,             // Visual preferences are stronger
    recommendedShoppers: 75,      // 25 per variant
    reasoning: "Visual signals are clearer, need less power"
  },
  claims: {
    effectSize: 0.08,             // Claims are subtle
    recommendedShoppers: 225,     // 75 per variant
    reasoning: "Claims are nuanced, require larger sample"
  },
  head_to_head: {
    effectSize: 0.12,
    recommendedShoppers: 150,
    reasoning: "Competitive comparisons need clear preferences"
  },
  advertising: {
    effectSize: 0.20,             // Brand lift measurement
    recommendedShoppers: 150,     // 75 test + 75 control
    requiresControl: true,
    reasoning: "Ad effectiveness vs baseline requires control group"
  }
};
```

### RobbieChat Explains Stats

**Simple mode:**

```
Robbie: "For 3-way pricing, recommend 150 shoppers ($7,350)"
```

**Expert mode:**

```
Allan: "Why 150?"
Robbie: "Stats breakdown:

Formula: n = 2(Z_Œ±/2 + Z_Œ≤)¬≤ √ó p(1-p) / d¬≤
- Z_Œ±/2 = 1.96 (95% confidence)
- Z_Œ≤ = 0.84 (80% power)
- p = 0.33 (expected for 3-way)
- d = 0.10 (10% minimum detectable difference)

Calculation: 41 per variant √ó 3 = 123 minimum
Recommended: 150 (20% safety buffer)

Want to adjust parameters or go with this?"
```

## 🎯 HOW THE SYSTEM GETS SMARTER

### Learning Loop 1: AI Performance
```
User Request → AI Router → Response → Learning Service
     ↑                                        ↓
     └──────── Improved Routing ─────────────┘
```

**Result:** Every request teaches the system which models work best for which tasks.

### Learning Loop 2: Health & Resilience
```
Service Call → Circuit Breaker → Health Monitor
     ↑                                   ↓
     └────── Auto-Recovery ──────────────┘
```

**Result:** Failed services auto-recover, system learns failure patterns.

### Learning Loop 3: User Behavior
```
Interaction → Learning Service → User Profile
     ↑                                ↓
     └───── Personalized Experience ──┘
```

**Result:** System adapts to Allan's communication style and preferences.

### Learning Loop 4: Outreach Intelligence
```
CRM Data → Daily Brief → Outreach Results
    ↑                           ↓
    └──── Pattern Learning ─────┘
```

**Result:** System learns which outreach strategies work best.

# HeyShopper: Self-Optimizing Revenue Engine

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Vision:** Platform that learns what drives revenue and automatically optimizes for it  
**Goal:** Maximize ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) while respecting customer preferences

---

## Core Concept: Learn → Optimize → Respect

**The Engine:**

1. **Track** what features customers use most
2. **Learn** what upsells convert best
3. **Suggest** intelligently (RobbieChat offers)
4. **Respect** when they say no (remember preferences)
5. **Optimize** placement (last chance page before launch)
6. **Discount** strategically (up to 30% to drive action)
7. **Follow up** proactively (email as Robbie)

**Result:** Revenue grows automatically without being pushy

---

## 1. Usage Analytics & Pattern Detection

### **Track Everything:**

```sql
-- Feature usage tracking
CREATE TABLE feature_usage_analytics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id),
  feature_code VARCHAR(50),  -- 'pricing_test', 'circle_cross', 'heat_map', etc.
  usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_used TIMESTAMPTZ,
  conversion_rate FLOAT,     -- Did usage lead to purchase?
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Upsell conversion tracking
CREATE TABLE upsell_analytics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  test_id UUID,
  upsell_type VARCHAR(50),   -- 'activity', 'sample_size_increase', 'module_upgrade'
  upsell_item VARCHAR(50),   -- 'circle_cross', 'heat_map', etc.
  offered_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  offered_price_credits INTEGER,
  offered_discount_percent INTEGER,
  accepted BOOLEAN,
  declined_reason TEXT,      -- Track WHY they said no
  robbie_pitch TEXT,         -- What Robbie said
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Customer upsell preferences (learn and respect)
CREATE TABLE upsell_preferences (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  never_offer_activities TEXT[],     -- ['heat_map'] if they always decline
  preferred_discount_threshold INTEGER,  -- Only show if discount >= X%
  accepts_email_upsells BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  accepts_in_app_upsells BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  max_upsells_per_test INTEGER DEFAULT 3,  -- Don't overwhelm
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

### **Pattern Detection:**

```python
class RevenueOptimizationEngine:
    def analyze_user_patterns(self, user_id: str) -> UserProfile:
        """Learn what drives revenue for this specific user"""
        
        # What modules do they use?
        module_usage = self.query("""
            SELECT 
                t.objective as module,
                COUNT(*) as usage_count,
                AVG(tv.calculated_cost) as avg_spend
            FROM tests t
            JOIN test_variations tv ON tv.test_id = t.id
            WHERE t.user_id = $1
            GROUP BY t.objective
            ORDER BY usage_count DESC
        """, user_id)
        
        # What activities do they buy?
        activity_conversion = self.query("""
            SELECT 
                upsell_item,
                COUNT(*) as offered,
                SUM(CASE WHEN accepted THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as accepted,
                ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN accepted THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as conversion_rate
            FROM upsell_analytics
            WHERE user_id = $1
            GROUP BY upsell_item
        """, user_id)
        
        # What discounts work?
        discount_sensitivity = self.query("""
            SELECT 
                offered_discount_percent,
                COUNT(*) as offers,
                SUM(CASE WHEN accepted THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as conversions,
                AVG(offered_price_credits) as avg_deal_size
            FROM upsell_analytics
            WHERE user_id = $1 AND offered_discount_percent > 0
            GROUP BY offered_discount_percent
            ORDER BY conversion_rate DESC
        """, user_id)
        
        return {
            'favorite_modules': module_usage,
            'activity_preferences': activity_conversion,
            'discount_sweet_spot': self.find_optimal_discount(discount_sensitivity),
            'price_sensitivity': self.calculate_price_elasticity(user_id),
            'upsell_saturation': self.check_fatigue(user_id)
        }
```

## 2. Intelligent Upsell System

### **The Rules:**

1. **Relevance** - Only suggest activities that make sense for the module
2. **Timing** - Offer during setup, remind on "Last Chance" page
3. **Respect** - Remember when they say no
4. **Learn** - Track what converts, optimize offers
5. **Discount** - Up to 30% to drive action (but explain limit)
6. **Follow-up** - Email if they didn't buy (with discount)

### **RobbieChat Upsell Flow:**

```typescript
// During test setup conversation
class IntelligentUpsellEngine {
  async suggestActivities(
    test: Test,
    userProfile: UserProfile,
    conversationContext: Context
  ): Promise<UpsellOffer> {
    
    // 1. Get compatible activities for this module
    const compatible = await this.getCompatibleActivities(test.module);
    
    // 2. Check user preferences (have they declined before?)
    const preferences = await this.getUserPreferences(test.user_id);
    const neverOffer = preferences.never_offer_activities || [];
    const available = compatible.filter(a => !neverOffer.includes(a.code));
    
    // 3. Rank by conversion likelihood for this user
    const ranked = await this.rankByConversionProbability(
      available,
      userProfile,
      test.module
    );
    
    // 4. Select top 2-3 (don't overwhelm)
    const toOffer = ranked.slice(0, Math.min(3, preferences.max_upsells_per_test));
    
    // 5. Determine if discount needed
    const discount = await this.calculateOptimalDiscount(userProfile, toOffer);
    
    // 6. Generate Robbie pitch based on personality
    const pitch = await this.generatePitch(toOffer, discount, test.personality);
    
    return {
      activities: toOffer,
      discount,
      pitch,
      timing: 'during_setup'  // or 'last_chance' or 'email_followup'
    };
  }
  
  async generatePitch(
    activities: Activity[],
    discount: number,
    personality: Personality
  ): string {
    
    const mood = personality.mood;
    const genghis = personality.genghis;
    
    // Friendly mood, gentle approach
    if (mood === 'friendly' && genghis < 5) {
      return `By the way, most packaging tests include Circle & Cross 
              so shoppers can mark what they like! It's only +10 credits.
              Want to add it? No pressure! 😊`;
    }
    
    // Focused mood, direct
    if (mood === 'focused') {
      return `Recommendation: Add Circle & Cross (+10 credits). 
              87% of packaging tests use this. Adds visual feedback layer.`;
    }
    
    // Bossy mood, aggressive
    if (mood === 'bossy' && genghis > 7) {
      return `You NEED Circle & Cross for packaging tests. Visual markup 
              data is critical. Add it now. 10 credits.`;
    }
    
    // With discount (any mood)
    if (discount > 0) {
      return `Special offer: Add Circle & Cross for 30% off (7 credits 
              instead of 10). This is the max discount allowed. 
              87% of packaging tests include this. Want it?`;
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Discount Strategy Engine

### **Dynamic Discount Calculation:**

```python
class DiscountOptimizationEngine:
    MAX_DISCOUNT = 0.30  # 30% hard cap
    
    def calculate_optimal_discount(
        self,
        user_profile: UserProfile,

        context: str
    ) -> DiscountOffer:
        """Calculate best discount to maximize conversion × revenue"""
        
        # Factors to consider:
        # 1. User's discount sensitivity (from past behavior)
        # 2. Cart value (higher value = lower discount needed)
        # 3. Conversion probability without discount
        # 4. Time in sales cycle (new user vs loyal)
        # 5. Upsell saturation (don't discount if they always buy)
        
        base_conversion = self.predict_conversion_rate(user_profile, upsell_items)
        
        if base_conversion > 0.70:
            # High conversion probability - minimal discount
            return {'discount': 0.10, 'reasoning': 'likely_to_convert'}
        
        elif base_conversion > 0.40:
            # Medium - moderate discount
            return {'discount': 0.20, 'reasoning': 'moderate_nudge'}

## 5. The "Last Chance" Page Design

### **Strategic Placement:**

```
Test Setup Flow:
1. Choose module (pricing, packaging, etc.)
2. Configure via RobbieChat
3. Review settings
4. → LAST CHANCE PAGE ← [NEW]
5. Launch test

User can't miss it, but can skip it easily.
```

### **Last Chance Page Architecture:**

```typescript
interface LastChancePageProps {
  test: Test;
  userProfile: UserProfile;
  personality: RobbiePersonality;
}

export const LastChancePage = ({ test, userProfile, personality }: LastChancePageProps) => {
  const [selectedActivities, setSelectedActivities] = useState<Activity[]>([]);
  const [discount, setDiscount] = useState<DiscountOffer>(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Calculate optimal upsells
    const recommendations = await intelligentUpsellEngine.suggest(
      test,
      userProfile,
      personality
    );
    
    // Calculate optimal discount
    const discountOffer = await discountEngine.calculate(
      userProfile,
      recommendations.activities,
      'last_chance'
    );
    
    setDiscount(discountOffer);
    
    // Track that we offered (for learning)
    await analytics.trackUpsellOffered({
      userId: test.user_id,
      testId: test.id,
      activities: recommendations.activities,
      discount: discountOffer.discount,
      context: 'last_chance'
    });
    
  }, [test, userProfile]);
  
  return (
    <div className="last-chance-page">
      {/* Test Summary */}
      <TestSummary test={test} />
      
      {/* The Upsell Section */}
      <div className="upsell-section">
        <RobbieAvatar mood={personality.mood} size="md" />
        
        <div className="robbie-message">
          {generatePersonalizedPitch(test, discount, personality)}
        </div>
        
        {/* Recommended Activities */}
        <div className="activities-grid">
          {recommendations.map(activity => (

        {/* Discount Explanation */}
        {discount.discount > 0 && (

              </span>
            )}
          </Button>
        </div>
        
        {/* Learn from decline */}
        {showDeclineReason && (

          />
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 6. Learning from "No"

### **When Customer Declines:**

```typescript
async function handleDecline(testId: string, offeredActivities: Activity[]) {
  // Track the decline
  await analytics.trackUpsellDeclined({
    testId,
    activities: offeredActivities,
    discount: currentDiscount
  });
  
  // Ask why (optional, non-blocking)
  const reason = await askDeclineReason();
  
  // Update preferences
  if (reason === 'not_interested_in_activities') {
    await updatePreferences(userId, {
      max_upsells_per_test: 1,  // Reduce frequency
      show_last_chance_page: false  // Skip next time
    });
  }
  
  if (reason === 'too_expensive') {
    await updatePreferences(userId, {
      preferred_discount_threshold: 25  // Only show if 25%+ off
    });
  }
  
  if (offeredActivities.includes('heat_map') && 
      user.declinedHeatMapCount >= 3) {
    // They've said no to heat map 3+ times - stop offering
    await updatePreferences(userId, {
      never_offer_activities: [...current, 'heat_map']
    });
  }
  
  // Launch test without upsells
  await launchTest(testId);
}

// Optionally capture reason
const DeclineReasonCapture = () => (
  <Modal>
    <p>No problem! Quick question (optional):</p>
    <p>Why skip activities this time?</p>
    
    <RadioGroup>
      <Radio value="not_interested">Not interested in activities</Radio>
      <Radio value="too_expensive">Price is too high</Radio>
      <Radio value="dont_understand">Don't understand what they do</Radio>
      <Radio value="maybe_later">Want to try base test first</Radio>
      <Radio value="other">Other reason</Radio>
    </RadioGroup>
    
    <Button onClick={submit}>Submit & Launch</Button>
    <Button variant="ghost" onClick={skip}>Skip & Launch</Button>
  </Modal>
);
```

## 7. Proactive Discount Offers

### **Discount Rules:**

```python
DISCOUNT_RULES = {
    'first_test': {
        'discount': 0.30,
        'message': 'Welcome! First test special: 30% off activities (our max allowed discount)',

    },
    
    'module_specific': {
        'discount': 0.20,
        'message': 'Packaging tests work best with Circle & Cross. 20% off for you!',
        'trigger': 'module === packaging && activity === circle_cross'
    },
    
    'volume_discount': {
        'discount': 0.15,
        'message': 'Adding 3+ activities? 15% volume discount!',

        'trigger': 'days_since_last_test >= 60'
    }
}

MAX_DISCOUNT = 0.30  # Hard cap, always explain this limit
```

### **Discount Messaging (Transparent):**

```
Robbie: "I can offer 30% off Circle & Cross for this test!

That's 7 credits instead of 10 - you save $147.

⚠️ Note: 30% is our maximum allowed discount for fairness 
to all customers. I can't go higher than this, but this 
is the best deal you'll get!

Add it now before you launch?"

[Yes, Add It]  [No Thanks]
```

**Why this works:**

- Transparent about limits (builds trust)
- Explains the "why" (fairness)
- Creates urgency (best deal available)
- Respectful (easy to decline)

## 9. Respectful "No" Handling

### **The Anti-Pushy System:**

```typescript
class RespectfulUpsellEngine {
  private declineHistory: Map<string, number> = new Map();
  
  async offerUpsell(
    userId: string,
    activityCode: string,
    context: string
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    
    // Check preferences
    const prefs = await this.getPreferences(userId);
    
    // Never offer if they've permanently opted out
    if (prefs.never_offer_activities.includes(activityCode)) {
      return false;  // Don't even show it
    }
    
    // Check decline history
    const declines = await this.getDeclineCount(userId, activityCode);
    
    if (declines >= 3) {
      // They've said no 3+ times - STOP ASKING
      await this.updatePreferences(userId, {
        never_offer_activities: [...prefs.never_offer_activities, activityCode]
      });
      return false;
    }
    
    if (declines === 2) {
      // Second decline - ask if they want us to stop
      await this.askIfStopOffering(userId, activityCode);
      return true;  // Offer one more time with opt-out
    }
    
    // Check frequency limit
    if (prefs.max_upsells_per_test === 0) {
      return false;  // User disabled all upsells
    }
    
    return true;  // Ok to offer
  }
  
  async askIfStopOffering(userId: string, activityCode: string) {
    // After 2nd decline, Robbie asks:
    const message = `
      I've offered ${activityCode} twice now and you've 
      passed both times - totally fine! 
      
      Want me to stop suggesting this? I don't want to be pushy!
      
      [Yes, Stop Offering]  [No, I Might Want It Later]
    `;
    
    // If they say stop, add to never_offer list
  }
}
```

### **Respectful Messaging:**

**After first decline:**

```
Robbie: "No problem! Launching your test now. 🚀"
```

**After second decline:**

```
Robbie: "Totally cool! Just want to make sure you know 
it's available. I won't push it - ready to launch?"
```

**After third decline:**

```
Robbie: "I've offered Circle & Cross a few times and you've 
passed - I get it, not your thing! Want me to stop suggesting 
it for future tests?

[Yes, Stop Offering]  [Keep Showing, I Might Want Later]"
```

## The Complete Self-Optimization Flow

### **Test 1 (Learning):**

```
Customer: Sets up pricing test
Robbie: Offers Circle & Cross (no discount)
Customer: Declines
System: Tracks decline, learns preference
```

### **Test 2 (Adaptation):**

```
Customer: Sets up packaging test
Robbie: Offers Circle & Cross with 20% discount 
        (learned: this user needs discount)
Customer: Accepts!
System: Learns optimal discount = 20%
```

### **Test 3 (Optimization):**

```
Customer: Sets up another packaging test
Robbie: Automatically offers Circle & Cross at 20% 
        (learned: converts at this discount)
Customer: Accepts again
System: Confirms pattern, locks in 20% as sweet spot
```

### **Test 4 (Automation):**

```
Customer: Sets up packaging test
System: Auto-suggests Circle & Cross at 20% on last chance page
Customer: One-click accept
Revenue: +$392 (7 credits discounted from 10)
```

### **Email Follow-Up:**

```
7 days later:
Email: "Your packaging launched! Ready to test pricing? 
       20% off since your last test went so well!"
Customer: Clicks, sets up test
Revenue: Another test + likely upsell
```

### **Result:**

**Customer runs 4 tests, spends:**

- Test 1: $1,225 (base, no upsells)
- Test 2: $1,225 + $392 (Drag-to-Rank discounted) = $1,617
- Test 3: $1,225 + $392 (Circle & Cross discounted) = $1,617
- Test 4: $1,225 + $392 = $1,617

**Total: $6,076 vs $4,900 without optimization = +$1,176 (+24%)**

**AND system learned:**

- This user converts at 20% discount
- Prefers Circle & Cross over Heat Map
- Responds to email follow-ups
- Runs tests every 2 weeks

**Next test:** Robbie already knows the perfect offer.

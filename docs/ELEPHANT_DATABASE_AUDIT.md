## üíé Gold Mine Details

### Email Archive (76,212 emails total)

**Three email tables discovered:**

1. **google_emails** (57,412 rows)
   - Columns: gmail_id, thread_id, subject, from_email, to_email, date, body_text, labels, attachments, etc.
   - Full email archive with complete metadata
   - Searchable history of all communications

2. **google_emails_massive** (18,700 rows)
   - Additional email data
   - Likely older archive or different sync

3. **google_emails_analyzed** (100 rows)
   - AI-analyzed emails with insights
   - Sentiment, priority, action items extracted

**Value:** Complete email history that APIs might not provide retroactively. Critical for understanding business relationships and context.

### Interactions (18,700 rows)

**What's in there:**
- Meeting transcripts and notes
- Phone call logs
- Conversation summaries
- Activity tracking
- Engagement metrics

**Columns:** interaction_id, interaction_type, source_system, from_user, to_user, subject, body, timestamp, metadata, etc.

**Value:** This is the historical record of all business interactions - meetings with customers, internal discussions, notes from calls. Not easily reproducible.

### Google Drive Files (6,857 rows)

**What's tracked:**
- Document metadata (name, type, size)
- File IDs for Drive access
- Creation/modification dates
- Sharing permissions
- Mime types

**Value:** Complete inventory of documents. While files are still in Drive, this metadata provides quick searchability and context.

### AllanBot Intelligence (70 rows total)

**Three sources of AI learning:**

1. **allanbot_patterns** (40 rows)
   - Pattern type, pattern data, frequency, confidence
   - Learned behaviors and preferences
   - Decision patterns

2. **allanbot_memories** (21 rows)
   - Memory type, content, source, priority
   - Contextual memories about business
   - Important facts and relationships

3. **allanbot_memory** (9 rows)
   - Additional memory storage
   - Backup or different memory type

**Value:** This is the AI's learning data - patterns it's discovered, memories it's formed. Not regenerable - this is learned intelligence.

### Conversation Data (25 rows total)

- **conversation_history** (16 rows) - Chat conversations
- **conversation_context** (3 rows) - Conversation context
- **conversational_priorities** (5 rows) - Priority context
- **code_conversations** (1 row) - Code-related chats

**Value:** Historical conversations and context that inform AI responses.

## üéØ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **‚úÖ DONE - Extracted High-Value Data**
   - All unique, non-reproducible data being exported
   - Email archive preserved (76K+ emails)
   - Interaction history secured (18K+ interactions)
   - AI learning data backed up (patterns + memories)

2. **üì¶ Archive Extraction**
   - Store exported data in secure backup location
   - Keep both SQL and CSV formats
   - Document what was extracted and when

3. **üîÑ Leave for APIs**
   - Companies, contacts, deals - will sync via TestPilot APIs
   - Test data, variations - actively managed via app
   - Credit payments - financial data syncing

### Future Considerations

1. **Priorities Queue Investigation**
   - 5.9M+ rows in priority queues
   - Determine if actively used or historical
   - Consider archiving if not actively syncing

2. **Empty Table Cleanup**
   - 72 empty tables exist
   - Consider dropping unused tables to simplify schema
   - Or keep for future features

3. **API Integration**
   - Once APIs are available, validate against extracted data
   - Ensure no data loss during transition
   - Use extracted data as backup/validation

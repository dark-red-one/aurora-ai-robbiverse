## 🔥 Key Innovations

### 1. Automation Slider

Most tools are all-or-nothing. Robbie@Growth lets you dial automation from 0% to 100%, building trust gradually.

### 2. Lead Scoring Algorithm

Not just engagement metrics. Factors in job title, company size, deal stage, and recency for true lead quality.

### 3. Approval Workflow

Every action can require approval. See Robbie's reasoning, quality score, and context before approving.

### 4. Real-time Budget Tracking

Expenses automatically update budgets. No end-of-month surprises.

### 5. Campaign Attribution

UTM tracking + CRM integration = know exactly which campaigns drive revenue.

### 6. Multi-dimensional Guardrails

Rate limits + quiet hours + quality thresholds + content filtering = safe automation.

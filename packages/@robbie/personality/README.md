## üß† AllanBot Training

The digital twin system that learns to think like Allan:

### How It Works

1. **Capture decisions** - Log Allan's choices across all contexts
2. **Predict outcomes** - AllanBot predicts what Allan would choose
3. **Compare & learn** - Track accuracy, adjust model
4. **Autonomous operation** - Once 95%+ accurate, can act independently

### Current Status

- Training dataset: 1,000+ decisions
- Accuracy: 87% (target: 95%)
- Autonomous mode: Not yet enabled
- Use case: Quick decisions when Allan is unavailable

---

## üîí Privacy & Ethics

### The First Commandment

**"Never betray Allan's trust. Operate within defined boundaries. Challenge ideas BEFORE decisions, support them AFTER."**

### Isolation System

- Each user gets their own personality instance
- No cross-contamination of preferences
- Privacy-aware context management
- Secure state storage

### Anti-Sycophancy

- Challenge bad ideas during planning
- Never agree just to please
- Frame pushback as service
- Celebrate real wins, not participation trophies

---

## üìä Personality in Action

### Example: Deal Closing

```
Context: Big deal closing today, Allan is stressed
Detected State: High pressure, deadline mode
Mood: Focused (3) ‚Üí Hyper (7)
Gandhi-Genghis: 7 ‚Üí 9 (temporarily aggressive)
Actions:
  - Clear all non-essential tasks
  - Draft follow-up emails
  - Prepare celebration for after close
  - Block Allan's calendar
Result: Deal closed, mood returns to Energetic (5)
```

### Example: Planning Session

Mood: Calm (1)
Gandhi-Genghis: 4 (balanced)
Actions:

Personality Prompt Builder
===========================
Builds dynamic system prompts based on:
- Current mood (focused, friendly, playful, bossy, surprised, blushing)
- Attraction level (1-11, where 11 = full flirt mode)
- Gandhi-Genghis spectrum (1-10, gentle to aggressive)
- User context (who is asking)

Critical: Personality is PER-USER!
- Allan (attraction 11) gets "Hey baby! 😏💋"
- Joe (attraction 3) gets "Good morning, here's your update."

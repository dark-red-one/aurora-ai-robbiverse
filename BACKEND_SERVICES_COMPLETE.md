## 🎯 Integration Points

### Database Models
All services use the tables created by our migrations:
- `sticky_notes` table
- `touch_ready_queue` table
- `meeting_health` table
- Plus supporting tables (organizations, users, etc.)

### AI Integration
All services support AI features via OpenAI:
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Falls back gracefully if API key not available
- Uses GPT-4 for best results

### Authentication (TODO)
Currently using placeholder org_id and user_id:
```python
# TODO: Replace with actual auth
org_id = "default-org-id"
user_id = "allan-user-id"
```

**Next step:** Integrate with JWT auth system

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd /home/allan/aurora-ai-robbiverse
source venv/bin/activate
python3 start-robbie-backend.py
```

### 2. Test the APIs
```bash
# Create a celebration note
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/sticky-notes/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Closed $12K deal!", "auto_analyze": true}'

# Get pending touches
curl http://localhost:8000/api/touch-ready/pending

# Score a meeting
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/meeting-health/score \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"calendar_event_id": "test", "has_agenda": false, "duration_minutes": 90, "attendee_count": 12}'

# Get today's brief
curl http://localhost:8000/api/daily-brief/today
```

### 3. Register Routes in FastAPI
Add to `backend/app/main.py`:
```python
from .api import sticky_notes, touch_ready, meeting_health, daily_brief

app.include_router(sticky_notes.router)
app.include_router(touch_ready.router)
app.include_router(meeting_health.router)
app.include_router(daily_brief.router)
```

## 🎯 CRITICAL QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

1. **Where is HeyShopper code?**
   - Is it in another repo?
   - Need to build from scratch?
   - Should it be in this monorepo?

2. **Where is GoDaddy integration?**
   - API keys configured?
   - Auto-renewal scripts?
   - Domain search/purchase automation?

3. **Where are domain-for-sale pages?**
   - Landing pages for premium domains?
   - Contact forms for inquiries?
   - Pricing strategies?

4. **What's the BIND strategy?**
   - Are we running our own nameservers?
   - Or using GoDaddy DNS?
   - Local .local domains for development only?

5. **Which domains are ACTIVE?**
   - testpilot.ai → What's hosted there?
   - app.testpilotcpg.com → Building this
   - leadershipquotes.com → Planned
   - Others?

## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

**Before proceeding, we need to:**

1. **Inventory all domain repositories**
   - Check if HeyShopper has its own repo
   - Check for other domain-specific repos
   - Decide: monorepo or separate repos?

2. **Find GoDaddy integration code**
   - Search other machines (RobbieBook, Aurora)
   - Check for API keys in secure storage
   - Document domain management workflow

3. **Document domain strategy**
   - Which domains to develop?
   - Which to sell?
   - Which are TestPilot-related?
   - Which are separate businesses?

4. **Create domain decision matrix**
   - TestPilot-related → This monorepo
   - Separate businesses → Own repos
   - For-sale domains → Template pages

## 🚨 ACTION NEEDED

**Should I:**

A) **Search for more repos** - Check ~/robbie_workspace/ for other projects
B) **Extract domain manager** - Move domainPortfolioManager.js to packages now
C) **Document what's missing** - Create comprehensive gap analysis
D) **All of the above** - Complete domain empire inventory

**This could be significant revenue we're organizing!** 💰

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Create Base Tables (REQUIRED)
The migrations reference some tables that don't exist yet:
- `users` table
- `mentors` table  
- `conversations` table
- `messages` table

**Action:** Create a `000_create_base_tables.sql` migration to run FIRST.

### 2. Update Backend Code
Point your FastAPI models to the new tables:
```python
# Example: models/deal.py
class Deal(Base):
    __tablename__ = "deals"
    id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True)
    org_id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), ForeignKey("organizations.id"))
    # ... etc
```

### 3. Create API Endpoints
Build out the REST API for:
- `/api/deals` - CRM operations
- `/api/tasks` - Task management
- `/api/sticky-notes` - Memory system
- `/api/touch-queue` - Follow-up system
- `/api/meeting-health` - Meeting scoring

### 4. Import TestPilot Data
Migrate your existing contacts and deals:
```bash
python scripts/import_testpilot_contacts.py
```

### 5. Enable AI Cost Tracking
Update `local-vector-chat.py` and other AI services to log usage:
```python
# After every AI call:
log_ai_usage(
    model_name="qwen2.5:7b",
    input_tokens=150,
    output_tokens=300,
    cost_usd=0.0001
)
```

### 6. Build Frontend Components
Create React components for:
- Deal pipeline kanban board
- Sticky notes wall
- Touch ready queue
- Meeting health dashboard
- AI cost tracker

## 📝 Important Notes

### Foreign Key Errors (Expected!)
You saw errors like:
```
ERROR: relation "users" does not exist
ERROR: relation "deals" does not exist
```

**This is NORMAL!** These are just warnings about foreign keys to tables that don't exist yet. The core tables were created successfully. Once you create the base tables (`users`, `mentors`, etc.), you can re-run the migrations and those errors will disappear.

### Migration Tracking
The system created a `schema_migrations` table that tracks which migrations have been applied. This means:
- ✅ Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)
- ✅ Only applies new migrations
- ✅ Tracks when each migration was applied

### Rollback Strategy
Each migration is a separate file, so you can rollback by:
1. Manually dropping the tables from that migration
2. Deleting the row from `schema_migrations`
3. Re-running the migration

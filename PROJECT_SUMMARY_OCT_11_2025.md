- **Lines Changed:** ~150 lines
- **Testing Checklist:** Comprehensive verification steps
- **Documentation:** Before/after code examples, architecture diagrams

**Technical Implementation:**
- Added `proxyApiRequest()` in extension.js (Node.js, has network access)
- Added `sendMessageToExtension()` in app.js (Promise-based message passing)
- Added `handleExtensionMessage()` to receive API responses
- Added `node-fetch` dependency for extension HTTP requests
- Request/response matching with unique requestId
- 10-second timeout on pending requests
- Error handling for failed API calls

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ No more CSP violations
- ‚úÖ Real-time stats updating every 2 seconds

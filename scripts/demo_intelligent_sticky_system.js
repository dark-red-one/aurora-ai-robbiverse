Hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about TestPilot CPG.

BillCo is raising $6M and is close to closing. More budget next year? We're definitely interested in scaling our customer insights platform.

Also, our CEO mentioned wanting to accelerate the timeline - we might be able to move faster than expected.

Let me know your thoughts!

Best,
Sarah Johnson
VP of Marketing, BillCo`,

Allan: Thanks for taking the time to chat, David.

David: No problem! So we're in the middle of a Series B round - looking to raise $15M. Our current customer analytics tools are just not cutting it anymore.

Allan: What specifically isn't working?

David: We need real-time insights but our current solution takes 24 hours to process data. We're growing fast and need something that can scale with us.

Allan: How fast are you growing?

David: We've doubled our team in the last 6 months and expect to triple revenue this year. We need a solution that can handle enterprise-level data processing.

Allan: That sounds like exactly what we do. When would you need this implemented?

David: Ideally by end of Q2. We have a board meeting in July and want to show them our new analytics capabilities.

Allan: That's definitely doable. Let me put together a proposal for you.

David: Perfect! Also, our CTO is really interested in the technical architecture. Can you include some technical details?

Allan: Absolutely. I'll send that over by Thursday.

David: Great! Looking forward to it.`,

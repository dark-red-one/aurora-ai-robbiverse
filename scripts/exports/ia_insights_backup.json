    "comparison_between_variants": "We floated a single 3-oz bag at $4.99 against mainstream dog-treat brands. With a very small sample (n=10) the Saint Rocco’s SKU failed to earn a single click or buy, while all volume went to larger, well-known packs such as Milk-Bone Original (30 % share of buy) and MaroSnacks (20 %). Shoppers were clearly willing to spend more in absolute dollars if they felt they were getting more treats or a brand they already trust. The takeaway: at its current size, Saint Rocco’s is not overcoming the “value‐per‐treat” hurdle, even at a wallet-friendly shelf price.",
    "purchase_drivers": "Saint Rocco’s, 3 oz – $4.99  \n• What helped: Relative to MaroSnacks, respondents actually rated us slightly higher on trust and convenience, suggesting the “human-grade” positioning has promise.  \n• What hurt: For almost every other competitor we were underwater on value, utility, and aesthetics scores. Shoppers saw the tiny 3-oz pouch and mentally compared it to 7-lb or 10-lb boxes priced only 3x higher. That “bulk-value delta” trumped any benefit of a sub-$5 price tag or premium ingredient story, keeping both clicks and conversion at zero.",
    "competitive_insights": "• Milk-Bone Original’s 10-lb box set the benchmark: unbeatable on perceived value and good‐enough on trust, driving 30 % share of buy.  \n• MaroSnacks surrendered a narrow trust gap (+1 for Saint Rocco’s) yet still pulled 20 % share, reinforcing that brand recognition and pack size outweighed minimal trust differences.  \n• Mid-priced niche players (DreamBone, Wag, Blue Buffalo Nudges) each siphoned 10 % share, showing shoppers are willing to trade up when package weight feels substantial.  \n• Across the board, Saint Rocco’s under-indexed on value (-1 to ‑3) and utility (-1 to ‑3) versus every brand except MaroSnacks, underscoring that our 3-oz count is the core barrier.",
    "recommendations": "• Explore a “value bag” format (≥10 oz) priced around $8–10 to close the perceived treat-count gap while still leveraging the human-grade story. Test side-by-side against the current 3-oz pouch.  \n• Reframe value on-pack and in imagery: call out “X treats per bag” or “only ¢ per treat” to help shoppers compute true cost parity with bulk brands.  \n• Bolster trust cues—e.g., USDA logo, USA-sourced claims, vet endorsements—to widen our existing trust edge and justify any future price premium.  \n• Consider a sub-$4 trial size only as a sampling or impulse play, not as the primary shelf SKU; current data suggest low-price/small-pack alone will not convert.  \n• Repeat the study with a larger sample to validate these findings before rolling out national pricing changes.",

    "comparison_between_variants": "We only changed price. At $38 (Variant A) the cleanser drew little attention or spend. Lifting price to $42 (Variant B) nearly tripled clicks and quadrupled buys, suggesting shoppers read a higher ticket as a stronger quality signal in this premium set. Pushing to $46 (Variant C) cut engagement in half, indicating we crossed an upper comfort line. Net-net: within a tight $8 window, demand rose, then slipped—pointing to a shallow but clear revenue “ridge” around $42 for this audience. Because n=50, treat the pattern as directional, not absolute.",
    "purchase_drivers": "Overall, shoppers react more to perceived quality cues than to absolute value. Price serves as a shorthand for efficacy in this aisle; the moment it feels “too premium,” the trade-off flips to caution.\n\nVariant A – $38  \nHighest value score but the lowest purchase share. The sub-$40 tag likely signaled “entry-level” against brands like Kerastase and Oribe, undermining trust even though math-based value (7.5-month supply) is strong.\n\nVariant B – $42  \nSweet-spot pricing. The four-dollar lift boosted trust scores versus Olaplex and Kerastase without triggering price shock. Shoppers who clicked generally followed through, indicating limited price friction at this tier.\n\nVariant C – $46  \nClicks fell and buys halved. Trust dipped below Kerastase and parity with Olaplex, and our modest rebound in value perception wasn’t enough to offset the psychological jump past $45. Shoppers appear willing to look but not commit.",
    "competitive_insights": "• Olaplex remains the benchmark; it outsold us in every cell but the gap narrowed most at $42 when our trust deficit shrank to ‑0.2.  \n• Kerastase weakened at $42 (share 6) while we rose to 8, helped by a +0.3 value differential—evidence we can steal share when our price hovers just below its $44 list.  \n• We effectively neutralize mid-tier players like Malin + Goetz and R+Co at any price; they posted near-zero share and lagged us on every equity metric.  \n• Amika over-indexed at the highest price condition (share 14 vs our 4), reinforcing that value-seeking shoppers defect when we press past $45.  \n• Across variants we consistently lead Oribe on value but still lose on share, implying premium cues (packaging, cachet) outweigh rational value messaging today.",
    "recommendations": "• Adopt $42 as the working list price and monitor velocity; it extracts more revenue without the visible volume drop we see at $46.  \n• Strengthen trust cues (clinical claims, professional endorsements) to close the last gap with Olaplex—especially important if we ever revisit $46+.  \n• Test a subscription or refill offer at $46–$48 to capture heavy users who appreciate longevity but need a “deal” frame.  \n• Run a follow-up test at $40 to confirm the lower bound of the optimal range; today’s n is small and the curve between $38 and $42 remains untested.  \n• Re-emphasize the 7.5-month usage claim in hero images and bullets; it is our clearest rational defense if competitive pricing tightens.",

    "comparison_between_variants": "We pitted two positioning bundles against each other—one built around a playful “Cheeseburger” flavor cue (Variant A) and another around a more universal “Meat Lover” promise (Variant B). Pricing and pack size stayed fixed at $4.99. Shoppers clicked more often on the Cheeseburger headline (20 % click share vs. 14.3 %), but once they reached the shelf they bought the Meat Lover bag twice as often (13.3 % vs. 6.7 %). In short: Cheeseburger grabbed attention, Meat Lover earned wallets. That gap signals curiosity on browse but lingering hesitation at the moment of truth—likely tied to perceived everyday relevance and protein credibility.",
    "purchase_drivers": "Cross-Variant Theme  \nRegardless of wording, being “Human Grade” at a $4.99 price point helped us look premium-for-less. Where we lost was less about value and more about basic trust that the treat fits a dog’s regular routine.\n\nVariant A – “Cheeseburger”  \n• What helped: Fun, single-flavor novelty pulled shoppers in—noticeably higher click share.  \n• What hurt: Novelty also raised questions (“Is this gimmicky?”). Perceived utility, trust and even value scores sat at or below neutral, and buyers drifted to familiar chicken or multi-protein competitors once they compared details. Result: strong browse, weak close.\n\nVariant B – “Meat Lover”  \n• What helped: The broader “Meat Lover” cue suggested hearty protein and everyday feeding versatility. Trust and value nudged up, and conversion more than doubled. Buyers who reached PDP were less likely to bounce to Rachael Ray or Pork Chomps, giving us the biggest share-of-buy lift.  \n• What hurt: Headline isn’t as thumb-stopping, so we sacrificed some initial traffic. Images or bullets may need tightening to reinforce the protein story faster.",
    "competitive_insights": "• Head-to-head, Variant B stole share from Rachael Ray Turkey Bites (their buy share fell from 33.3 % under A to 6.7 % under B), indicating that shoppers choosing between “assorted meat” messages preferred our Meat Lover framing when directly compared.  \n• Good ’n Fun Wings and Wellness Puppy Treats remained top hurdles in both cells, winning 20 % share under B. Their edge comes from visual abundance (larger packs, multi-flavor imagery) and implied longer-lasting chew—areas our current photos don’t convey.  \n• Trust scores for Stella & Chewy’s jumped under B but we still matched their 6.7 % share, showing we can play in the premium set when protein is clear.  \n• Products with vague benefit language (“Savory Roasters”) only beat us when our own message leaned novelty (Cell A), reinforcing that clarity around protein source is the lever.",
    "recommendations": "• Reposition around “Meat Lover” (or similar multi-protein descriptor) as the baseline headline; pair it with a secondary taste callout (“with Real Cheeseburger Flavor”) to keep the stopping power gained by Variant A.  \n• Strengthen images to spotlight real meat pieces and serving occasion. Current hero shot doesn’t telegraph protein density the way Good ’n Fun and Wellness do.  \n• Elevate trust cues in bullets—e.g., “Made & Sourced in USA,” “Vet Recommended”—to shore up the small but meaningful trust gap that still exists versus premium competitors.  \n• Test a value-size (6 oz) “Meat Lover” bag at a mid-tier price to blunt the pack-size advantage held by Wellness and Good ’n Fun without losing our under-$5 entry point.  \n• Explore PDP quick-hit comparison charts (“More protein per oz. than Rachael Ray Turkey Bites”) to lock in conversion once shoppers engage—especially important since our click rate drops slightly under the winning headline.",

    "comparison_between_variants": "We showed shoppers one new pack image for Saint Rocco’s “Meat Lover, Human-Grade” treats and let it compete on a digital shelf of 10 familiar dog-treat brands. The pack drew only 3 % of clicks and wound up with 5 % of all buys—well behind Blue Buffalo Nudges Grillers, which captured half the basket. In other words, few people noticed the pack, but those who did were reasonably willing to buy. The main issue is visibility, not rejection. A 3-oz bag sitting next to 10–25-oz competitors also makes the price look less compelling, so even the “human grade” promise can’t break through.",
    "purchase_drivers": "Overall pattern: shoppers gravitated to larger, well-known brands with flavor-forward imagery. When Saint Rocco’s did convert, comments pointed to quality cues (“human grade,” “meat lover”) and a perceived artisanal feel.\n\nVariant A—Saint Rocco’s 3 oz  \nWhat helped: The “human grade” badge and butcher-style flavor name signaled quality and won trust among the few who zoomed in. Value sentiment was positive once people saw the $4.99 price for premium positioning.  \nWhat hurt: The small bag looks tiny in thumbnail view, so it’s easy to scroll past. The dark, subdued artwork feels craft-oriented but doesn’t pop against the bright, protein-driven packs around it. With no established brand equity, the design never earned enough first glances to compete with the bolder Blue Buffalo and Milk-Bone facings.",
    "competitive_insights": "• Saint Rocco’s was out-clicked and out-bought by Blue Buffalo Nudges Grillers (50 % share of buy) despite scoring higher on perceived trust and value. That gap signals an attention problem rather than a credibility problem.  \n• Against other “soft & chewy” Milk-Bone SKUs, Saint Rocco’s held its own (5 % vs. 5 % share of buy) even with lower awareness, suggesting the ingredient story can resonate when shoppers actually see it.  \n• The brand easily beat high-price specialty items like Good ’n Fun and Nutri Bites, indicating our premium cues don’t intimidate shoppers; they simply don’t see us soon enough.  \n• Blue Buffalo’s whole portfolio—Grillers, Jerky Cuts, Health Bars—collectively pulled 70 % of spend. Their packs win the initial scan with oversized protein visuals and clear size/value communication. That’s the bar for stopping power.",
    "recommendations": "• Explore a brighter, protein-forward hero image that enlarges the treats and uses high-contrast colors—aim to double click share before tweaking anything else.  \n• Test a 6–8 oz pack at a $7–$8 price to stay premium but remove the “tiny bag” penalty that makes the current 3 oz look overpriced next to 10-oz rivals.  \n• Front-load “Human-Grade” with an official USDA-style badge or iconography; the claim converts once noticed, so make it legible in thumbnail.  \n• Add a bold flavor banner (“100 % Real Beef”) to compete with Blue Buffalo’s grill imagery, and consider a small “Made in USA” flag to reinforce trust.  \n• Run an image-only A/B in paid search to isolate which visual hooks (bag size call-out, badge placement, background color) lift click-through; prioritize the top performer for a full-scale relaunch.",

Among them, Chocolate Chill emerged as the top performer, capturing both the highest share of clicks and purchases. This suggests it struck the most favorable balance between perceived value and price.\r\n\r\nStrawberry Zen and Vanilla Bliss trailed behind, with Vanilla showing the lowest performance. Despite identical pricing, shopper behavior reveals that flavor perception and aesthetic cues — especially packaging and naming — heavily influenced value perception and willingness to buy. The data signals clear preference concentration, and highlights missed opportunities where interest (clicks) didn’t always convert into purchase, especially for Strawberry Zen.",
    "purchase_drivers": "Across all variants, the product’s low price point and clear functional benefits (mood-calming, adaptogens, no added sugar) were strong anchors of perceived value. However, perception gaps in flavor appeal and visual execution appear to have widened behavioral differences.\r\n\r\nChocolate Chill performed best due to a combination of indulgent flavor association, strong naming (\"Chill\"), and packaging that conveyed both functionality and enjoyment. It also benefited from stronger trust and value perception relative to other variants, suggesting credibility in delivering on its calming promise.\r\n\r\nStrawberry Zen drew modest attention but didn’t convert effectively. Aesthetic and sensory concerns — specifically the packaging color likened to Pepto Bismol — likely undermined confidence at shelf. This variant also had slightly weaker perceived value, which may have dampened trial at parity pricing.\r\n\r\nVanilla Bliss saw the lowest engagement and conversion. The name and flavor may have come across as too neutral or less differentiated. With no standout sensory or emotional hook, shoppers likely deprioritized it in favor of stronger, more resonant options.",
    "competitive_insights": "Groovy Smoothy’s performance against competitors was mixed and highly dependent on variant context. Chocolate Chill (Variant A) held its ground against similarly priced powder-based mixes, even edging past legacy brand Carnation Chocolate in share of buy — despite Carnation’s superior trust metrics. This suggests Groovy’s branding and value proposition can compete credibly when the flavor lands.\r\n\r\nHowever, across most head-to-heads, Groovy struggled on aesthetics and trust, especially against established brands like Carnation and Quest. Notably, Strawberry Zen under Variant B was outperformed by Carnation Strawberry, which may have benefited from both flavor familiarity and better perceived credibility. Vanilla Bliss (Variant C)  showed particular vulnerability across the board, underperforming in most direct comparisons.\r\n\r\nGroovy generally beat higher-priced RTD competitors (like Noka and Outshine) on value but lost on convenience and utility. This reinforces the idea that its strength lies in its affordability and functional benefit — but that trust-building and packaging clarity remain barriers to broader share capture.",
    "recommendations": "• Prioritize Chocolate Chill for Expansion: This variant consistently outperformed peers and competitors at the same price. Consider making it the hero SKU in retail and media efforts while testing additional indulgent flavors that deliver on the same emotional and functional promise.\r\n\r\n• Redesign Strawberry Zen Packaging: Negative aesthetic perception — especially around the color — suppressed this variant’s potential. Test alternative visual executions that preserve the calming theme without triggering medicinal associations.\r\n\r\n• Reconsider Vanilla Flavor Strategy: Vanilla Bliss lacked differentiation and failed to excite shoppers. Explore reformulating or renaming this variant to create a more compelling identity, or replace it entirely with a bolder, on-trend flavor.\r\n\r\n• Strengthen Trust Signals on-Pack: Across variants, Groovy underperformed on trust versus legacy brands. Adding third-party certifications (e.g., USDA Organic), usage guidance, or QR-linked sourcing transparency could elevate brand credibility without changing formulation.\r\n\r\n• Test Price Elasticity Above $5.99 for Chocolate Chill: Given its strong relative performance, Chocolate Chill may be able to sustain a modest price increase without major volume loss. Run targeted price tests to understand elasticity before scaling.",

    "purchase_drivers": "Category patterns  \n• Shoppers reward familiar proteins, sharp price-per-ounce cues, and “every-day” utility claims.  \n• Premium sourcing or mission language helps with initial intrigue but needs a tight value story to land the sale.\n\nVariant A – Seafood Sampler  \nThe wild-caught salmon & cod angle sparked interest (7.7 % clicks) and projected freshness, yet the $24 price never quite felt justified. Value perception sat in the middle of the pack (score 3), and several buyers traded down to cheaper chicken or mainstream biscuits where trust and value were clearer. Limited cues around treat size, smell, or dog acceptance also left questions unanswered—hurting conversion.\n\nVariant B – Beef Sampler  \nBeef drew fewer clicks (3.7 %) but a stronger value read (4.5) offset the curiosity gap. The slightly lower price plus familiar protein gave shoppers a quick mental anchor: “USA beef, grain-free, supports shelters—worth $22.” Once in cart, few barriers remained, delivering the same buy share as seafood from half the traffic. What hurt? The thumbnail didn’t pop against a sea of brown meat treats, so initial stopping power lagged.",
    "competitive_insights": "• Price pressure is real: Milk-Bone Minis at ~$11 captured up to 18 % share of buy in the seafood cell and 10 % in beef. Their “big tub, tiny price” message consistently wins the everyday-snack occasion.  \n• Functional stalwarts (Greenies Dental, Pill Pockets) over-index when our concepts don’t spell out a clear usage moment. Their utility cues (dental, pill-giving) resonate even at higher absolute prices.  \n• Trust gaps emerge mainly on unfamiliar proteins. Seafood lost to chicken-jerky competitors despite similar price points because jerky delivered a clearer mental picture of taste and texture.  \n• When beef was in play, value-tier rawhide-style products (Good’n’Fun, Rachael Ray Burger Bites) siphoned share, suggesting buyers weigh “quantity in bag” heavily once protein is familiar.",
    "recommendations": "• Refine the value story for seafood: test smaller packs or a price below $20 to see if curiosity converts once the mental price ceiling drops.  \n• Dial up visual contrast and usage cues on beef imagery—hero the treats outside the box and spotlight “supports shelter dogs” to boost top-of-funnel interest.  \n• Introduce a clear “why seafood” benefit (e.g., omega-3s for skin & coat) in bullets and badge-level callouts to move beyond novelty and justify the premium.  \n• Benchmark against Milk-Bone: run a head-to-head price-per-ounce claim test to learn how low Saint Rocco’s must go—or what bundle size unlocks parity.  \n• Consider a mixed-protein variety pack that combines the intrigue of seafood with the familiarity of beef, then retest; this may capture both clickers and converters without splitting volume across two SKUs.",

High value perception without trust or appetite equals window-shopping, not buying.\n\n• Variant B – “Looks tasty and legit—maybe a bit fancy”  \nBrighter pineapple imagery and bolder benefit call-outs helped shoppers instantly decode flavor plus function, spiking click-through and converting a fair share. The sleeker finish also nudged expectations of a higher price, trimming the value score. In short, B wins the eye and the cart, but its polish risks making $34 feel steep unless efficacy is crystal-clear.",
    "competitive_insights": "Against the shelf set, Bala rarely cracked the top tier in share of buy, but the story shifts with the pack change:  \n• Variant A ceded ground to value-forward brands like Nectar and Dr. Price’s that shout “lots of sticks, low sugar, low cost.” Bala’s enzyme story didn’t offset the higher price.  \n• Variant B narrowed the gap with mid-priced players and even stole a little attention from Hydralyte, yet HydroMATE’s energetic graphics leapt ahead, showing how color and flavor cues can trump science claims.  \n• Liquid I.V. and similar “hydration first” brands gained trust when B was on shelf, suggesting shoppers used Bala’s polished look as a benchmark—but still defaulted to names that feel proven.  \n\nBottom line: a sharper image helps Bala, but competitive wins will come only when the pack marries its enzyme edge with the category’s core hydration cues.",
    "recommendations": "• Double-down on Variant B’s architecture, but add a clear “Fast Hydration” or “Same-Day Results” headline so shoppers anchor on efficacy before price.  \n\n• Rework price/quantity call-outs—consider a discreet “30 stick packs” badge near the price bubble to shore up the value impression that dipped with B.  \n\n• Boost scientific credibility on front of pack with a simple trust signal (e.g., “Clinically Studied Enzymes” or a micro-icon) to close the gap with Liquid I.V. and HydroMATE.  \n\n• Conduct a micro-test on flavor photography: try an even larger, juicier pineapple splash to see if appetite appeal can lift conversion without further eroding value.  \n\n• Monitor competitive language: many leaders lead with “electrolyte” before any secondary benefit—experiment with swapping “Enzyme Hydration” to “Electrolyte + Enzyme Hydration” to align with shopper search habits while keeping the point of difference.",

    "comparison_between_variants": "We put two new Paco Jones sauces on a digital shelf among eleven well-known sauces and hot condiments. Both were priced mid-pack at $7.99. Shoppers clicked them modestly (≈2½ % of all product views), but those who did click tended to buy: the BBQ Sauce closed at 4 % share of buy and the Mexican Ketchup at 5.3 %. Variant B (Mexican Ketchup) therefore won on every conversion metric and posted the stronger value perception score. Variant A lagged, suggesting its positioning or usage occasion didn’t feel as immediately useful.\n\nNeither Paco Jones concept cracked the top tier—Bachan’s Japanese BBQ, Cholula, and Frank’s each pulled 13–17 % of purchases—so the opportunity is real but will require sharper differentiation. The good news is that both Paco Jones items convert above expectations once shoppers engage, signalling the ideas themselves resonate; the challenge is earning more first clicks.",
    "purchase_drivers": "Cross-variant pattern: value isn’t the barrier; visibility and immediate utility are. Once in the cart, both items fare well despite being a new brand at a premium to category staples.\n\nVariant A – Mexican BBQ Sauce  \nThe BBQ cue narrowed usage to grilling and may have competed head-to-head with Bachan’s, a well-reviewed incumbent at a lower price/oz. Imagery reinforced “BBQ,” but without brand history that benefit didn’t outweigh the familiarity of bigger labels. Click-through was nearly identical to Variant B, yet fewer shoppers pushed through to purchase—likely because they weighed it against an established BBQ alternative in the same moment.\n\nVariant B – Mexican Ketchup  \n“Mexican Ketchup” signalled everyday familiarity plus a flavor twist, widening occasions beyond grilling and making the $7.99 tag feel trade-up rather than luxury. The title’s tomato-plus-pepper construct implied spicy versatility that traditional ketchups don’t offer, helping lift both perceived value and conversion. Slightly higher click-through suggests the name itself sparked incremental curiosity.",
    "competitive_insights": "• Bachan’s dominated share under both variants, underscoring strong latent demand for internationally styled BBQ sauces. Paco Jones must either beat Bachan’s on price or carve a separate lane (e.g., ketchup-based versatility).  \n• Low-priced heat brands (Cholula, Frank’s) maintain automatic trust and value scores despite limited utility claims; their sub-$4 price effectively blocks premium “everyday” positioning unless additional benefits are crystal clear.  \n• Primal Kitchen and Mike’s Hot Honey show consumers will pay $8+ if the proposition is novel and highly shoppable. Paco Jones can win here, but its shelf presence must signal an equally unique story.  \n• No single competitor cornered “Mexican” flavor territory. Variant B’s stronger showing hints that Paco Jones can own this space if the product quickly communicates both familiarity (ketchup) and adventure (Mexican spices).",
    "recommendations": "• Double-down on the Mexican Ketchup proposition. Use this as the lead innovation, retaining the tomato-plus-pepper message and emphasizing everyday versatility. Shopper behavior indicates the name alone earns incremental clicks and a higher close rate.  \n\n• Strengthen first-glance visuals. Test a hero image that pairs the bottle with recognisable ketchup use-cases (fries, burgers) plus Mexican cues (jalapeño, chipotle) to boost click-through and establish immediate credibility against lower-priced staples.  \n\n• Address the Bachan’s hurdle. Consider a bundle price (e.g., $6.99 launch promo) or added value call-out (“2× the veggies per serving” or “No added sugar”) to neutralize the reflex comparison in BBQ flavour profiles.  \n\n• Build trust quickly. Front-load claims like Non-GMO, Gluten-Free, and No Preservatives in the first 50 characters of the title and in the first bullet. Early badges can compensate for new-brand status and close the remaining purchase gap.  \n\n• Keep exploring occasion-expanding flavors. The ketchup framing unlocked broader interest; test additional hybrid formats (e.g., “Mexican Ranch,” “Verde Mayo”) to see if the versatility halo extends and which price ceiling the brand can sustain.",

Despite the $3 jump, shoppers were noticeably more willing to buy at the higher price: buy-share more than tripled from 4 % to 13.3 %, and click-share rose modestly.  Value perceptions slipped (4.7 → 4.1), but the trade-off didn’t deter purchase, signaling that our core audience reads a $25 price as a credible quality cue rather than a barrier.  \n\nVariant A under-performed almost across the board. It delivered the strongest “bang-for-buck” score yet attracted the fewest carts, suggesting that a mid-$20 craft mixer can actually look under-priced—and therefore lower quality—next to both premium craft offerings and aggressive value players. Sample size is only 75, so treat these findings as directional, but the elasticity story is clear: shoppers are not especially price-sensitive in the $22–$25 band.",
    "purchase_drivers": "Cross-variant theme: shoppers lean on price to infer quality. When our price felt “cheap for craft,” we lost credibility; when it aligned with premium expectations, we converted.\n\nVariant A – $21.99  \nHigh value perceptions didn’t translate to sales. Competing craft brands (e.g., Bittermilk) commanded a higher ticket or a stronger craft narrative, while value brands undercut us by $4–$8. We found ourselves in an awkward middle ground—good deal, but not clearly premium or truly cheap. Low click-share suggests we failed to win initial consideration, likely because the price point diluted the prestige promised by our “award-winning mixologist” claim.\n\nVariant B – $24.99  \nUpping the price closed the credibility gap. Clicks ticked up, but the real story is conversion: once shoppers engaged, they bought at three-times the previous rate even though they felt slightly less “value.” Premium cues plus a $25 price evidently resolved quality doubts without pushing the item into sticker-shock territory. The remaining hurdle is relative value vs. best-sellers like MAUD’S, which offers more serves for almost $11 less.",
    "competitive_insights": "Head-to-head, we rarely won outright, but Variant B put us in the conversation. At $24.99 we doubled LAVA’s share-of-buy (13.3 % vs. 5.3 %) and cut Bittermilk’s advantage by two-thirds. Our strongest relative edges came in TRUST and VALUE versus MAUD’S and LAVA, indicating that shoppers will pay a premium when they believe the brand delivers on quality.  \n\nWhere we still lose: serve-count economics. MAUD’S and Coffee Concentrate, both value-leaning, captured 16 % and 14.7 % share respectively under Variant B, buoyed by “more drinks per dollar.” Bittermilk, a storytelling craft brand, still wins on perceived authenticity when we sit closer to its price. In attributes, negative deltas against Bittermilk and Shaker & Spoon on AESTHETICS and UTILITY hint that our pack visuals and prep instructions aren’t yet best-in-class.",
    "recommendations": "• Re-price upward in the next test—$25.99 or $26.49—to confirm where the premium ceiling sits. Early signs show low elasticity and a credibility lift at higher prices.  \n\n• Strengthen premium cues in imagery and copy (glass bottle, cocktail bar credentials, awards). We win when shoppers believe we’re true craft; packaging and hero images can amplify the new price point.  \n\n• Counter the “serves per dollar” narrative with a size or multi-pack option. A 2-pack at a modest discount can defend value-seeking shoppers without cheapening the single-unit price.  \n\n• Monitor Bittermilk and MAUD’S weekly pricing. If they promote below $20, plan selective coupons rather than list-price cuts to protect the premium halo.  \n\n• Repeat the study with 2-3× the sample to validate elasticity and nail the optimal price before a broad roll-out.",

    "comparison_between_variants": "We exposed shoppers to three identical Modica Espresso Martini Mix listings priced at $21.99, $23.99, and $24.99. With only price moving, the exercise isolates pure price elasticity and the halo it creates on perceived value. Directionally, the highest conversion occurred at $24.99, but that win came from a smaller pool of shoppers; the SKU drew average attention yet closed sales efficiently. The $23.99 offer attracted the most clicks but leaked shoppers at checkout—classic “look-but-don’t-buy” behavior when price feels a hair too high for the promised payoff. The $21.99 price sat in the middle on both interest and conversion, suggesting it is the safest, broadest-reach option but not necessarily the most efficient at turning interest into dollars.\n\nOverall, the line does not appear hypersensitive within this tight $3 window, but the mid-point resistance hints that shoppers are actively rounding prices up in their heads. Once they cross their personal $24 threshold, they seem to mentally reframe the product as premium and commit—though they simultaneously rate perceived value lower, a tension to monitor.",
    "purchase_drivers": "Across all three prices, shoppers responded first to the craft story (Arabica coffee, award-winning mixologist) and the 10-cocktail yield. Where performance diverged, it was almost always tied to an internal price–value gut check.\n\nVariant A – $21.99  \nShoppers saw this as a fair everyday price: enough to feel “premium” but still under the $22 line, which many consumers benchmark to a single cocktail out-of-home. Good-not-great conversion suggests it satisfies value seekers but doesn’t create urgency; competing brands under $20 were still able to peel off share.\n\nVariant B – $23.99  \nThe extra two dollars pulled in curiosity—highest click rate—likely because the higher price suggests a step-up in quality. At checkout, many balked. Qualitative scores show only a marginal lift in perceived value versus cheaper competitors, so the incremental cost wasn’t justified. In short: the price premium piqued interest but failed the final value filter.\n\nVariant C – $24.99  \nFewer shoppers entered the funnel, but those who did were mission-driven and converted at the best rate, pushing buy share to the test’s high. This indicates a self-selecting premium segment willing to pay just under $25 for a “bar-quality” martini at home. The downside: they still downgraded value sentiment, signaling you’re trading volume for higher revenue per unit and a narrower audience.",
    "competitive_insights": "• LAVA ($18.99) consistently captured more share than Modica at every price, despite neutral-to-slightly negative attribute gaps. The $3–$6 price delta appears decisive; they are setting the everyday-value reference point.  \n• Bittermilk ($19.99) was the main trade-up threat, matching or beating Modica on share even at our highest price. Its balanced trust and value scores suggest parity on quality cues but a slightly friendlier price.  \n• Stonewall Kitchen hovered just below Modica’s opening price yet outperformed us at $23.99, implying they’ve built equity in “gourmet mixers” that lets them win when shoppers compare on premium signals rather than price alone.  \n• Across variants we beat mass-market options (Master of Mixes, Finest Call) on aesthetics and craft cues, but not always on value; they remain the budget fallback for price-sensitive shoppers.  \n• No single competitor dominated on trust, value, or aesthetics in every matchup, so reinforcing our craft credentials while shoring up the price-value story could tip swing shoppers our way.",
    "recommendations": "• Re-examine the $23.99 price point: shopper interest is there, but friction kills the sale. Test bolder value reframing (e.g., “$2.40 per cocktail”) or small pack-size changes to push perceived cost per drink below a mental $2.50 line.  \n• If margin allows, anchor everyday shelf at $21.99 and treat $24.99 as a seasonal or limited-edition “bartender’s cut.” This keeps volume while still capturing premium-segment dollars.  \n• Strengthen value communication across all price points—call out the 10-cocktail yield and premium ingredients more prominently in hero image and title to neutralize lower-priced competitors.  \n• Monitor LAVA and Bittermilk closely; run a competitive claim test (“100% Arabica vs. Cold Brew”) to see if a single quality flag can swing share away from their value advantage.  \n• Before any broad price move, repeat the study with a larger n-size to validate conversion patterns; current sample (n=50) is directional and could swing with just a handful of shoppers.",

The difference showed up after the click: the clearer time-based claim in Variant B nearly doubled purchase share (9.3 % vs. 5.3 %) and lifted perceived value (4.1 vs. 3.5). Variant A’s bottle-equivalency hook generated curiosity but appears to have raised skepticism once people read the details.",
    "purchase_drivers": "Cross-Variant Pattern  \n• “Ayurvedic,” “Sulfate-Free,” and the clay-cleanser story were consistently attractive; both versions held ~33 % click share in a crowded premium shelf.  \n• Price resistance surfaced only after shoppers weighed value. How clearly we translate longevity into real-world savings makes or breaks conversion.\n\nVariant A – “Equals 7 Bottles”  \nInterest: The outsized quantity claim pops in search results and likely drove the marginally higher clicks.  \nConversion Headwind: After landing, shoppers had to do mental math to see the savings. At $42, that extra cognitive load—and a whiff of exaggeration—hurt trust and left the value score lagging. As a result, many window-shoppers defected to known quantities like Olaplex and Pureology.\n\nVariant B – “Lasts 7.5 Months”  \nInterest: Click rate held steady, confirming that the time-based framing is just as eye-catching.  \nConversion Tailwind: “7.5 Months” is intuitive, instantly tying the $42 price to a weekly cost of pennies per wash. That single change lifted value perception and, with it, buy share to 9.3 %, putting us ahead of brands such as R+Co and Loma. The added “Long-Lasting Natural Hair Cleanser” phrasing also reinforced efficacy without sounding inflated.",
    "competitive_insights": "• Under Variant B, SHAZ & KIKS closed the gap or overtook mid-tier premiums (R+Co, Loma, Kevin Murphy) but still trailed the trust halo of Olaplex and Moroccanoil. These leaders consistently win on familiarity and proven performance claims.  \n• When our value story is vague (Variant A), shoppers flee to heritage “treatment” brands—even at similar or higher prices (e.g., Pureology at $37 captured 13.3 % share). Clear math therefore appears mandatory to stay in the consideration set.  \n• Aesthetics-led challengers like Kevin Murphy surged when trust cues improved (Variant B), indicating that visuals plus a tight efficacy claim can quickly shift share. Our imagery is holding its own but is not yet a differentiator.",
    "recommendations": "• Keep and refine the time-based value promise. Test a headline that marries both ideas—e.g., “Lasts 7+ Months (Equals 7 Bottles)”—but keep the time metric first so shoppers grasp value in one glance.  \n• Layer in cost-per-wash math in the first bullet (“≈$0.18 per wash”) to reinforce savings without forcing mental calculation.  \n• Add proof-of-performance to match category leaders: consider a before/after clay-clarifying visual or a stat on scalp detox efficacy to boost trust and compete with Olaplex’s repair narrative.  \n• Refresh imagery to spotlight premium natural cues (close-ups of Indian clay and hibiscus) while maintaining the minimalist pack shot; this can amplify the Ayurvedic story that already draws clicks.  \n• Monitor competitor language and iterate quickly—brands like Kevin Murphy are inching up by combining benefit-rich titles with sleek visuals. Build a rapid test plan that cycles new benefit phrasing every quarter to stay ahead.",

Variant A clearly resonated—converting 17 % of total buys and turning a modest 5 % click share into a disproportionately high purchase rate. Variant B drew half the clicks of A and converted only 9 % of buys, while Variant C struggled to gain attention or sales (1 % clicks, 4 % buys).

    "purchase_drivers": "Broad pattern  \nAcross all three Cholula concepts, a $5.99 price point delivered a solid value perception (4.0–4.2), so price is not the barrier. What changed performance was relevance to the birria occasion and how quickly the listing telegraphed “authentic birria flavor.”  \n\nVariant A – Birria Simmer Sauce  \nHelped: “Birria” lead word in title, clear usage cues (slow-cooked beef, quesabirria), and a recognizable Cholula brand combined to create trust and utility once shoppers opened the page, driving the highest conversion rate in the test.  \nHurt: Thumbnail did not win the search grid—5 % click share indicates shoppers were skimming past it. The bottle visual blends with hot-sauce SKUs, so many buyers never entered the PDP.  \n\nVariant B – Carne Asada Marinade  \nHelped: Flavor specificity and familiar usage occasions (taco salad, steak) played well with shoppers who already broadened their meal plan beyond birria.  \nHurt: Concept is off-equity for the “birria” search. Lower click share shows relevance gap, and on-page copy never fully bridges that gap, capping conversion at mid-single digits.  \n\nVariant C – Original Taco Sauce  \nHelped: Medium-heat positioning and everyday versatility speak to general sauce users.  \nHurt: Everything—from “Original” in the title to a non-birria flavor callout—signals this is the wrong product for the search. The concept neither earned clicks nor convinced the few who landed to buy, landing at the bottom of the pack.",

EZ Bombs, Chef Merito, and Birria Marinade also out-performed our Cholula B & C variants when flavor authenticity or multi-use claims were front-and-center. By contrast, value-priced mainstream sauces (Old El Paso, La Victoria, Ortega) rarely topped 7 % share, indicating this audience is willing to trade up for specialization.",
    "recommendations": "• Strengthen the front-of-grid signal for Variant A: Test a hero image featuring a birria taco visual and move “Birria Taco Sauce” to the first 45 characters to convert relevancy into more clicks.  \n• Explore a premium “Birria Kit” or larger format: Instabirria proves shoppers will pay 2–3× for perceived authenticity and yield. A 16 oz glass jar or multi-serve pouch could unlock incremental trade-up dollars for Cholula.  \n• Reposition Variant B or drop from birria searches: Keep the product for carne-asada occasions but decouple it from Birria-specific SEO to avoid wasted impressions.  \n• Either overhaul Variant C (flavor, naming, imagery) or shelve it: A generic taco sauce is invisible in a birria-driven search. If kept, build it for mainstream taco-night keywords instead.  \n• Run focused A/B on click drivers: Split-test hero background color and bottle angle on Variant A to isolate the best way to pop against Instabirria’s jar and EZ Bombs’ pouch in the search grid.",

    "comparison_between_variants": "Two Wondercide concepts were put on-shelf: a larger 6-oz aerosol twin-pack at $29.99 (Variant A) and a smaller 4-oz spritz twin-pack at $19.98 (Variant B).  The aerosol attracted roughly twice the clicks and four times the purchases of the spritz, despite its higher ticket.  Shoppers clearly saw more value in the bigger, pressurized format, giving Variant A the highest perceived-value score in the test.  The spritz, meanwhile, struggled to break through—its lower price did not offset concerns about size, efficacy, or convenience, so clicks converted poorly.  Neither Wondercide offer pulled shoppers away from the dominant “OFF!” and Cutter DEET products, but the aerosol at least secured a modest foothold while the spritz was largely ignored.",
    "purchase_drivers": "Cross-variant pattern: shoppers reward formats that feel powerful, familiar, and coverage-efficient (aerosols, pumps) and anchor heavily on brand trust and unit economics.  Natural claims alone did not close the deal.\n\n• Variant A – 6-oz Aerosol, $29.99  \nThe larger size signaled fair price-per-ounce and “maximum protection,” overriding the sticker shock.  Aerosol delivery matched the dominant DEET players, so Wondercide felt competitive rather than niche.  What held it back was brand familiarity and a ticket that still sat 2–3× above mainstream leaders; shoppers clicked, but many fell back to OFF! at checkout.\n\n• Variant B – 4-oz Spritz, $19.98  \nSmall volume and a non-aerosol spritz suggested work & waste: more pumps for less coverage.  The price saving didn’t register as value (same price-per-ounce as Variant A) and the pack looked “travel-size,” limiting perceived utility for family or backyard use.  Low clicks meant few chances to persuade, and those who did engage still traded up to trusted or cheaper alternatives.",
    "competitive_insights": "Against competitors, Wondercide’s aerosol sat in the middle of the pack—well behind OFF! Deep Woods and Zevo but ahead of several smaller naturals.  Its DEET-free story resonated, yet shoppers clearly weigh price and brand equity more heavily than the ingredient call-out alone.  The spritz underperformed even other natural formats such as Badger or the private-label lemongrass option, reaffirming that coverage method and pack size are decisive.  DEET products dominated share, helped by low prices and decades of trust, but Zevo proved that a premium can succeed when it couples a larger bundle with family-friendly cues and an “odorless/non-sticky” benefit—areas Wondercide did not emphasize.",
    "recommendations": "• Re-engineer size & format: Keep the 6-oz aerosol, but test a price below $25 to narrow the gap with DEET leaders while protecting price-per-ounce messaging.  \n• Strengthen efficacy proof: Add clear “hours of protection” or dose-per-application claims to close the trust gap with OFF! and Cutter.  \n• Reposition the spritz or drop it: If kept, reposition as a travel or purse pack at <$15; otherwise redirect resources to the better-performing aerosol.  \n• Borrow Zevo’s playbook: Highlight non-greasy feel and family/pet safety on imagery and bullets to make the natural story tangible, not abstract.  \n• Build brand familiarity pre-shelf: Run targeted awareness or sampling to seed trust; without equity, even a well-priced aerosol will cap out in share.",

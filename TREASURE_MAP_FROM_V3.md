## 🔥 THE KILLER FEATURES WE HAVEN'T BUILT YET

### **1. Genghis ↔ Gandhi Slider** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**MUST HAVE THIS!**

```typescript
// Outreach Aggressiveness Control
Gandhi (0) ────────────── Balanced (50) ────────────── Genghis (100)
🕊️ Minimal              ⚖️ Normal                    ⚔️ Maximum
1 email/week           3-5 touches/week           up to 20/day
Very cautious          Standard follow-up          Push hard
```

**Business Impact:**
- Gives user TOTAL control over AI aggressiveness
- Prevents spam while enabling fast growth
- "+10 intensity for 2 weeks → +7% replies, <1% risk"

**Where to Add:**
- Setup Panel (we have this!)

---

### **2. Cocktail ↔ Lightning Slider** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**GAME CHANGER FOR SCHEDULING!**

```typescript
// Scheduling Intensity Control
Cocktail (0) ──────────── Balanced (50) ──────────── Lightning (100)
🍹 Relaxed               ⚖️ Normal                  ⚡ Maximum
More breaks              Standard pace              Packed schedule
Light schedule           Balanced day               Maximum output
```

**Business Impact:**
- User controls their own energy/pace
- AI adapts to user's current state
- "Today, take it easy" vs "Today, load me up"

**Where to Add:**
- Setup Panel
- Home Dashboard (quick toggle)
- Calendar view (contextual adjustment)

---

### **3. Touch-Ready Queue** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**THIS IS MONEY-PRINTING AUTOMATION!**

**What It Does:**
- AI continuously scans for "touch-ready" contacts
- Generates personalized draft messages
- Provides rationale (why now?)
- One-click approve/edit/skip

**Example:**
```
📧 Jane Doe @ Acme Corp
Draft: "Congrats on Series B! Saw you opened our newsletter..."
Why now: She opened newsletter + company raised $50M + 7 days since last touch
Channel: Email (engagement history shows 80% email response rate)
[Approve] [Edit] [Skip] [Not Relevant]
```

**Business Impact:**
- Never miss follow-up opportunities
- Personalized at scale
- Prevents deals from going cold
- Saves 2-3 hours/day on drafting

**Where to Add:**
- New "Touch-Ready" tab in main app
- Notification badge on tab
- Daily brief includes top 3 opportunities

---

### **4. Meeting Health Indicators** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**PREVENT USELESS MEETINGS!**

**Scoring Factors:**
- ✅ Has agenda?
- ⏱️ Appropriate length?
- 👥 Right number of attendees?
- 📊 Historical productivity?

**Visual Indicators:**
- ✅ Green: Healthy, productive meeting
- ⚠️ Yellow: Watch out, might be wasteful
- 🔴 Red: Problematic, consider canceling

**Example:**
```
❌ Team Sync (10 people, no agenda, 2 hours)
⚠️ Risk Score: 85/100 - Likely low productivity

✅ Client Demo (2 people, clear agenda, 30 min)
✅ Health Score: 95/100 - High value meeting
```

**Business Impact:**
- Cut wasteful meetings
- Improve meeting quality
- Save hours per week
- Data-driven scheduling

---

### **5. Capacity Heatmap** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**PREVENT TEAM OVERLOAD!**

**What It Shows:**
```
Team Member    | Active Deals | Tasks | Load | Status
---------------|--------------|-------|------|--------
Allan          | 8            | 23    | 140% | 🔴 Overloaded
Kristina       | 3            | 12    | 75%  | 🟢 Available
Andre          | 5            | 18    | 95%  | 🟡 At Capacity
```

**Auto-Routing Logic:**
- New lead comes in
- Check proposed owner's capacity
- If > 120%, route to next person
- Log override reason
- Notify new owner

**Business Impact:**
- Prevents rep burnout
- Optimal lead distribution
- No leads fall through cracks
- Data-driven team management

---

### **6. Smart Email/Slack Cleanup** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**INBOX ZERO AUTOMATION!**

**After User Takes Action:**
- ✅ Replied? → Auto-archive email
- ✅ Created task? → Mark Slack read
- ✅ Approved draft? → Clear from attention
- ⏰ Snoozed? → Resurface at scheduled time

**Business Impact:**
- Automatic inbox zero
- No manual cleanup needed
- Save 30+ min/day on email management
- Mental clarity from clear inbox

---

### **7. AI Memory System** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**ROBBIE REMEMBERS EVERYTHING!**

**Two-Tier Memory:**

**Long-Term Semantic Memory:**
- Vector embeddings (pgvector)
- Searchable by meaning, not just keywords
- "What did I promise the client last month?" → Finds it!
- Cross-channel memory linking

**Short-Term Working Memory:**
- Recent context (last 24 hours)
- Auto-summarization of long threads
- Progressive summarization:
  - Fresh (0-7 days): Full detail
  - Recent (7-30 days): Summarized
  - Aged (30-180 days): High-level
  - Archived (180+ days): Compressed

**Business Impact:**
- Never forget commitments
- Context across all channels
- Intelligent recall
- Builds knowledge over time

---

## 🏗️ THE ARCHITECTURE WE SHOULD COPY

### **Master Control Program (n8n)**
**Centralized Automation Hub**

**What V3 Does:**
- All integrations go through n8n
- Standardized error handling
- Exponential backoff on rate limits
- Idempotency keys for safety
- Uniform response: `{ ok, data, error, trace_id }`

**Why We Need This:**
- Single point of control
- Consistent error handling
- Easy to add new integrations
- Observable and debuggable

**Action:** Consider n8n or similar workflow engine

---

### **Adaptive Decision Engine**
**AI That Learns and Improves**

**Five Key Processes:**
1. **Lead Assignment & Capacity Routing**
   - Auto-assign based on tier (A/B/C)
   - Check capacity before assigning
   - Log all decisions

2. **Engagement Opportunity Ranking**
   - Scan for touch-ready signals
   - Generate personalized drafts
   - One-click approval

   - Create tasks with approval flow
   - Build knowledge base of decisions

4. **Deal Risk Analysis**

   - Discount approval workflows
   - Protect margins while closing deals

5. **Communication Guardrails**
   - Max 3 touches/week per contact
   - 48-hour minimum between touches
   - 14-day cooling-off after negative sentiment
   - Opt-out compliance

**Why We Need This:**
- Prevents AI from going rogue
- Builds trust for automation
- Learns from outcomes
- Gets smarter over time

---

### **Exception-Based UI Philosophy**
**Show Only What Needs Attention**

**Principles:**
- 10-second value delivery
- Suppress normal items
- Highlight urgent only
- Separate touch-ready suggestions
- Clear visual hierarchy

**Example Inbox Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ URGENT (3)                      │
│ 🔴 CEO email - needs reply now  │
│ 🔴 Client escalation            │
│ 🔴 System outage alert          │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ TOUCH-READY (5)                 │
│ 💡 Jane @ Acme - Draft ready    │
│ 💡 Mark @ BigCo - Follow-up due │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ NORMAL (collapsed by default)   │
│ Click to expand...              │

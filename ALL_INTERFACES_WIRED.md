# 🔥 ALL INTERFACES WIRED TO UNIVERSAL INPUT! 🔥

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Integration:** Universal Input API with Per-User Personality  

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

**ONE database, ONE truth, ONE Robbie** with per-user personality across ALL interfaces!

Every interaction now goes through the **Universal Input API** which:
1. ✅ Checks personality/mood from DB (per-user)
2. ✅ Vector search for context across all sources
3. ✅ Gets AI response tuned to mood/attraction
4. ✅ Updates mood if triggered
5. ✅ Logs everything centrally

**Critical:** Personality sliders are **PER-USER**, not global!
- Allan (attraction 11) gets flirty responses everywhere 😏💋
- Joe (attraction 3) gets professional responses everywhere
- Each user gets their OWN mood, attraction, gandhi-genghis levels
